rayyan-304195114,Successful School Principals in Socioeconomically Disadvantaged Schools: A Grounded Theory Research from Turkish Context,2024.0,1,1,,,,,,"Duran, A. and Cemaloğlu, N.",,,,,"The purpose of this study was to delve into the characteristics, professional competencies, leadership attitudes, and behaviors of successful school principals (SSPs) in socioeconomically disadvantaged schools. Utilizing a systematic grounded theory method (SGTM), we conducted research in the provinces of Amasya, Çorum, Samsun, and Tokat in Türkiye. Purposeful and theoretical sampling methods were employed to recruit successful school principals, deputy principals, teachers, students, and parents from secondary schools affiliated with the Ministry of National Education (MoNE). The data draws on unstructured individual and focus group interviews, as well as documents and observations. All the data obtained were inductively analyzed through open, axis, and selective coding stages. Based on the codes, sub-categories, categories, themes, and dimensions from the analyses, we designed the Contextual Successful School Principalship Model (CSSPM), which falls into four dimensions as follows: individual, managerial, organizational, and instructional. SSPs in this study mostly tend to display paternalistic leadership attitudes and behaviors in terms of dedication and self-sacrifice, serving, intrinsic motivation, and influencing stakeholders. They exhibit almost all the attitudes and behaviors of servant leadership, act according to some national and moral values, and experience national attitudes such as patriotism and nationalism intensely. By giving importance to the academic socialization of students' mothers, successful school principals exhibit transformational and instructional leadership behaviors. They act strategically to directly involve mothers in enhancing student achievement, demonstrating their commitment to fostering an inclusive and supportive educational environment. © 2024, Ozgen Korkmaz.

We used PISA 2015 data covering 6,504 students and 256 school principals from German schools and 9,841 students and 268 school leaders from Chinese schools. Results identified three leadership styles in Germany, namely, transformational (23.4%), instructional (41.3%), and integrated (35.3%) leadership, and two leadership styles in China, namely, transformational (38.6%) and instructional (61.4%) principals. Principals with instructional and integrated leadership had higher student achievements in Germany, whereas only principals with transformational leadership had slightly higher student achievements in China. Moreover, three leadership styles in Germany and two in China showed their relationships with each domain of student achievement. In conclusion, principals in Germany and China had different priorities in leading schools. The differences that principal leadership made on student achievements highlighted the differences in principals’ situational context and leading characteristics between Germany and China. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","",,"",,,"",""

The investigator conducted a mixed method study using a survey questionnaire (to include research developed questions and questions from the Belief on Discipline Survey) and an open-ended question. The study examined principals and assistant principals who lead in secondary schools in northern Florida and assessed differences in the implementation of discipline policies between high poverty low-achieving (HPLA) and high poverty high-achieving (HPHA) schools and the impact on student achievement. The study also examined the factors these principals and assistant principals perceived as facilitating and hindering discipline policy. Descriptive statistics were used to examine demographic data. The study used a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) to assess differences in the perceived impact of school discipline policies on student achievement between principals and assistant principals (APs) at HPHA schools and HPLA schools. Qualitative data were analyzed using the constant comparative method. The results of this study suggest there were significant differences in the characteristics of principals and APs serving high poverty (HP) schools, differences in how principals and APs in HP schools perceive their discipline practices in relationship to student success. Also, the findings suggest there are some differences in the qualities of transformational leadership (TL) between principals and APs HPHA and HPLA schools. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","",,"",,,"",""
rayyan-304195148,School leadership and its impact on student achievement: The mediating role of school climate and teacher job satisfaction,2016.0,1,1,,,,,,"Dutta, V. and Sahney, S.",,,,,"Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to examine the role of teacher job satisfaction and school climate in mediating the relative effects of principals’ instructional and transformational leadership practices on student outcomes. Design/methodology/approach – Guided by strong evidence from theories on school leadership and work psychology, the authors hypothesized relations among dimensions of principals’ instructional and transformational leadership behaviors, teachers’ perception of the school climate (social and affective, and physical environment), their job satisfaction and student achievement. The benefits of the principal’s leadership behaviors for student achievement are primarily hypothesized as indirect, with either a weak or statistically non-significant direct positive effect on student outcomes. Path modeling was applied to validate a mediated-effects model using cross-sectional survey data (306 principals, 1,539 teachers) obtained from 306 secondary schools in the two Indian metropolitan cities of New Delhi and Kolkata. Findings – Principal leadership behaviors were not associated directly with either teacher job satisfaction or school-aggregated student achievement. Rather, the transformational leader behavior showed an indirect effect, through the social and affective component of the school climate, on teacher job satisfaction. The physical climate, however, appeared to play a dominating role in mediating the instructional leadership effects on teacher job satisfaction. Comparing the relative indirect effect sizes of the instructional and transformational leadership behaviors on student achievement, principals appear to favor the former approach. Originality/value – This study provides further empirical evidence that instructional leadership better captures the impact of school leadership on student outcomes, when compared to its transformational counterpart. By identifying the relative effects of different leadership practices, school leaders and educational practitioners can focus more on altering the distribution and frequency of those practices that work best for ameliorating student achievement levels. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","",,"",,,"",""

Research Methods: Empirical data were drawn from a 3-year mixed-methods national study (“Impact Study”) that investigated associations between the work of principals in effective and improving primary and secondary schools in England and student outcomes as defined (but not confined) by their national examination and assessment results over 3 years. The research began with a critical survey of the extant literature, followed by a national survey that explored principals’ and key staff’s perceptions of school improvement strategies and actions that they believed had helped foster better student attainment. This was complemented by multiperspective in-depth case studies of a subsample of 20 schools. Findings: The research provides new empirical evidence of how successful principals directly and indirectly achieve and sustain improvement over time through combining both transformational and instructional leadership strategies. The findings show that schools’ abilities to improve and sustain effectiveness over the long term are not primarily the result of the principals’ leadership style but of their understanding and diagnosis of the school’s needs and their application of clearly articulated, organizationally shared educational values through multiple combinations and accumulations of time and context-sensitive strategies that are “layered” and progressively embedded in the school’s work, culture, and achievements. Implications: Mixed-methods research designs are likely to provide finer grained, more nuanced evidence-based understandings of the leadership roles and behaviors of principals who achieve and sustain educational outcomes in schools than single lens quantitative analyses, meta-analyses, or purely qualitative approaches. The findings themselves provide support for more differentiated, context sensitive training and development for aspiring and serving principals. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","",,"",,,"",""

The methodology involved an analysis of findings from 27 published studies of the relationship between leadership and student outcomes. The first meta-analysis, including 22 of the 7 studies, involved a comparison of the effects of transformational and instructional leadership on student outcomes. The second meta-analysis involved a comparison of the effects of five inductively derived sets of leadership practices on student outcomes. Twelve of the studies contributed to this second analysis. The first meta-analysis indicated that the average effect of instructional leadership on student outcomes was three to four times that of transformational leadership. Inspection of the survey items used to measure school leadership revealed five sets of leadership practices or dimensions: establishing goals and expectations; resourcing strategically; planning, coordinating, and evaluating teaching and the curriculum; promoting and participating in teacher learning and development, and ensuring an orderly and supportive environment. The second meta-analysis revealed strong average effects for the leadership dimension involving promoting and participating in teacher learning and development and moderate effects for the dimensions concerned with goal setting and planning, coordinating, and evaluating teaching and the curriculum. The comparisons between transformational and instructional leadership and between the five leadership dimensions suggested that the more leaders focus their relationships, their work, and their learning on the core business of teaching and learning, the greater their influence on student outcomes. The article concludes with a discussion of the need for leadership research and practice to be more closely linked to the evidence on effective teaching and effective teacher learning. Such alignment could increase the impact of school leadership on student outcomes even further. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","",,"",,,"",""
rayyan-304195221,Principals’ experiences in the implementation of the English Language Proficiency Programme in Namibia,2020.0,1,1,,,,,,"Nekongo-Nielsen, H.N. and Ngololo, E.N.",,,,,"Purpose: Namibian principals are usually placed in leadership positions without orientation and are found to lack skills to supervise teachers in delivering instruction using the English language. Studies conducted elsewhere in the world found that effective school leadership is needed for the success of professional development programmes. The purpose of this paper is to explore principals’ lived experiences with regard to their roles in the implementation of the English Language Proficiency Programme (ELPP). Design/methodology/approach: This paper followed a qualitative inquiry with multiple case study designs to explore principals’ lived experiences during the implementation of the ELPP. Ten schools were selected for the analysis, two from each of the five regions. The schools were selected on the basis of remoteness, the total number of teachers who participated in the ELPP, school phases (i.e. primary and combined) and pre-test scores. Principals were interviewed using exploratory open-ended questions, and data analysis produced five categories under which the results were presented. Findings: The findings indicate that principals applied their individual logic to accommodate and implement the programme. They applied their individual productive leadership habitus to contextualise ELPP activities to ease their workload and appear corporative. Principals had significant influence on teacher learning and ensured successful implementation of a ministerial programme. Moreover, their leadership skills influenced the ways in which teachers received instruction and created a conducive learning environment. Owing to principals’ administrative, instructional and transformational leadership, many teachers participated and transcended upward and some were declared proficient in English. Research limitations/implications: This study research the effectiveness of leadership regarding English professional development programmes in achieving goals, explore power relations between school principals and education officials when developing and implementing professional development programmes and establish more efficient ways of providing a better leadership model for professional development programmes to achieve goals. Practical implications: This paper was limited to a few principals at rural schools in selected regions, therefore findings could not be generalised. Social implications: There is a need for creating opportunities for interactions among all stakeholders who are involved in the development and implementation of English proficiency programmes and to build power relations and work as a team to benefit schools. In order to enhance programme implementation and improve learning outcomes, there is also a need to provide feedback at intervals and find solutions to challenges as a team. Originality/value: Placing principals in situations without orientation triggered the need for specific leadership logic and particularities to be applied in a context for the success of the programme, which resulted in participation of more teachers in the ELPP. They applied their particularities and productive habitus through administrative, instructional and transformational leadership to enhance learning. Principals appointed English language teachers to instruct and mentor others, and consequently enabled some principals and teachers to exit the programme. Principals achieved these short wins upon realising that one has to cooperate with the authority to ensure achieving desired outcomes. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","",,"",,,"",""

This is a descriptive and correlational study which was carried out on 103 principals of high school (51 females and 52 males). Sampling method included stratified sampling proportional to the size and simple random sampling. To collect the data, Bass and Avolio's Transformational Leadership and principal's psychological empowerment of Spreitzer were used. Analysis of survey data was done by calculating frequencies, percentages, means, standard deviations, correlation coefficient test and stepwise regression coefficient test. The results showed that among a series of seven transformational leadership factors except for leadership that is based on non-interference which is used at an average level, the principals use other factors including: inspirational motivation, idealized influence, intellectual stimulation, contingent reward, personal considerations and management by exception at a high level, respectively. In the case of psychological empowerment variable, the mean scores of principals at all dimensions were placed in the range of high. In this regard, the dimensions of meaning and concept, ability, job satisfaction, the selection and effect obtained the highest mean, respectively. The results also showed that there was a relatively significant positive relationship between idealized influence and inspirational motivation factors of transformational leadership and all aspects of psychological empowerment. In general, there was a significant relationship between the two variables (r = 0.382).

This achievement is often defined as positive gains in attendance and test scores as discipline referrals and suspension numbers decrease. Socioeconomic and cultural contributions to student achievement are often relegated to secondary analyses, are used as deficit explanations when achievement is not increased, or are ignored completely. While this approach may give a snapshot of conditions at a given moment, it does not provide program evaluators with enough information to appropriately assess the implementation of interventions. This qualitative study examines the implementation and evaluation of a prosocial intervention in 10 schools serving American Indian families designed to reflect the culture of program participants and community stakeholders.

Referring to the full range leadership theory (FRLT), we examined the effects of transformational and passive leadership styles of university instructors on students' satisfaction and learning outcomes. Completed web-based questionnaires were obtained from 1270 students who enrolled in large academic courses led by instructors in web-based instructional environments. Data analyses confirmed the validity of the multifactor leadership questionnaire (MLQ) in the virtual asynchronous communication setting with three second-order factors model composed of transformational, active management-by-exception and passive leadership. Leadership styles correlated with student satisfaction: the more the students attributed transformational leadership style to the instructor and the less they attributed a passive leadership style, the more satisfied they were. The attributed leadership style was not related to the actual participation of the students in the virtual discussions or to their academic achievements. The findings suggest that subordinates' satisfaction might be tied more strongly to their perception of the leader than to the actual tangible benefits the leader can provide.

However, we currently face major challenges to maintain and promote people's health. Although these complicated problems pose numerous threats to public welfare, education of public health for health professionals still retains 20th-century standards. This also means that graduate education of public health in Japan is traditionally based on obtaining licensure as a medical professional, conducting research and writing papers, and on-the-job training. Since graduate school education is expected to produce competent public health leaders, Japan requires a reform toward a new education design that caters to the current societal needs. The current global trend in the education of health professionals leans toward outcome-based education to meet core competencies. Here, ""competency"" refers to a set of features or particular behavioral patterns possessed by highly qualified persons. In 2006, the World Health Organization (WHO) established a general health professional competency standard that includes both management and leadership competencies. Moreover, the Lancet Commission concluded that there was a need for transformative education based on a ""health system approach."" In brief, this means that our education should correspond to the needs of the health system to allow for the resolution of problems by educated professionals with satisfactory levels of competencies. In addition, as ""change agents,"" these competent professionals are expected to promote societal change toward the realization of better public health. In Japan, the Central Education Council has produced several reports on professional graduate school reform since 2000. These reports indicate that graduate school curricula require reform to allow the health professionals to work locally and globally, as well as to solve problems through the application of systematic knowledge that matches practice with theory. Therefore, with reference to the current Japanese health situation, global trends in education, and the Japanese educational policies, transformational changes are needed toward a new era of Japanese public health education specifically through outcome-based education to improve the health professionals competencies. We hope that education in the new schools of public health will contribute to solve authentic public health problems and create a healthy future with competent professionals.","",,"",,,"",""

However, existing research mainly focuses on qualitative discussions at the institutional level, and fewer studies are in-depth empirical investigations. Using field survey data of rural areas in Shaanxi Province of China in 2011, an in-depth empirical investigation of the relationship between village cadre competency and rural development, as well as the moderating effect of the village cadre social capital in this relationship, were explored in this study. Results show that three dimensions of village cadre competency (i.e. achievement motivation, individual influence and administrative leadership capabilities) are positively correlated with rural development. Achievement motivation of village cadres can stimulate individual behaviors, and individual influence and administrative leadership capabilities can benefit the establishment of a confidence mechanism and promote social innovation. Furthermore, the social capital of village cadres strengthens the positive relationship between village cadre competency and rural development. When village cadres possess richer network resources in social capital, their competency can easily promote rural development through mobilization of the social structure. The results obtained in this study reveal the relationships between village cadre competency, social capital, and rural development, which also support the discussion of social transformational development in rural areas at the micro-level to a certain extent. © 2016, Editura Lumen.

Our research reveals a nuanced relationship between varied leadership styles, institutional cultures, and the drive for innovation. Notably, transformational leadership aligns strongly with innovative outcomes and a collaborative institutional ethos, in contrast to the more rigid structures associated with authoritarian and laissez-faire leadership styles. The philosophical core of this inquiry lies in examining how leadership practices embody and promote ethical values that influence collective and individual success. Institutions that cultivate a culture of collaboration and are open to embracing risk are found to be more conducive to innovation. In contrast, settings that emphasize rigid hierarchies and prioritize individual achievement tend to stifle creative and innovative practices. Our findings emphasize the crucial role of leaders in shaping an ethical climate that nurtures innovation. Effective leadership is pivotal in fostering an environment supportive of progressive teaching and management strategies. This includes investing in faculty development, enhancing collaborative efforts, and acknowledging academic excellence. Moreover, the strategic integration of technology and a shift towards student-centred learning are identified as essential for advancing innovative teaching practices. By delving into the philosophical and ethical dimensions of educational leadership, this study contributes to a deeper understanding of how leadership rooted in ethical and collaborative values can profoundly impact educational innovation and success. The insights gained underscore the potential for educational leaders to drive significant change by adhering to philosophically and ethically sound practices. © (2024), (European Journal for Philosophy of Religion).

Further, role of leader member exchange (LMX) and the association period in between TL and RI as well as SWL shall also be examined. So, the present paper attempts to evaluate the moderated-mediated effect of TL on RI and SWL. Design/methodology/approach – The model has been tested in the higher education sector. Information regarding TL, LMX, SWL and RI has been procured from teachers. The data have been duly validated with the help of confirmatory factor analysis. Reliability has been assessed through Cronbach’s α and composite reliability. Structural equation modelling has been used for testing the hypotheses. Moderation has been checked through multi-group analysis. Findings – The results indicate that association period moderates the TL and LMX relationship. LMX mediates the TL and RI and SWL relationship. Finally, moderated- mediated impact of TL on RI and SWL have been found. Managerial, practical, social, economic implications and scope for future research have also been discussed. Research limitations/implications – This study represents a cross-sectional investigations as responses were gathered from respondents at a particular point of time. Moreover, the study is confined to government degree colleges operating in Jammu district only. In future longitudinal study can be conducted. Comparative study between private and public colleges can be undertaken in future. Practical implications – Leaders should focus on creating positive environment, where personal work goals of the subordinates are linked with organisational goals, with the help of role-person integration. Leaders should make their decisions more transparent by exhibiting consistency in their logic and reasoning. Remaining impartial in decision making will help leaders to instil trust and respect in the minds of subordinates. Trust among the followers can be increased through commitments and achievement of goals. Leaders should create more enthusiasm and optimism amongst the employees. Social implications – Leaders in education institutes should create social and emotional learning environment in the colleges. This can be done by arranging informal meetings, some kinds of fares, painting competitions and festive celebrations at collaborative level. This strategic action will help to provide an opportunity to all employees’ to come forward in an informal friendly environment, which will help to reduce stress, anxiety, and depression; and improve the quality of relationship and ultimately enhance satisfaction among followers’ with respect to their leaders. The followers work for the achievement of departmental as well as the organisational goals in collaboration with their leaders. Originality/value – The paper has evaluated the moderation of association period between TL and LMX relationship in higher education sector which has not been explored earlier in leadership studies. Many studies have evaluated the direct impact but moderated-mediated impact of TL on RI and SWL has not been evaluated earlier, which will contribute equally to academic as well as business world. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","",,"",,,"",""

This study conducts a comprehensive evaluation of current literature to examine the effects of several leadership styles, such as transformational, transactional, servant, and authentic leadership, on employee performance and competency. The main goal is to determine the impact of various leadership styles on the efficiency and contentment of employees in academic environments in shaping the values and culture of employees through the organizational strategies they implement. The technique included a Systematic Literature Review (SLR), utilising data from Scopus and Google Scholar, and implementing a meticulous selection process to incorporate pertinent research published from 2020 to 2024. 15 papers were examined, specifically investigating the correlation between leadership styles, employee performance, and competency. The results indicate that transformational leadership has a highly substantial beneficial influence on performance and competency, promoting creativity and employee engagement. Transactional leadership, although successful in ensuring stability and providing incentives for achievement, yields inconsistent outcomes. The servant and authentic leadership styles have a beneficial impact on employee satisfaction and organisational commitment, which in turn leads to enhanced performance. On the other hand, laissez-faire leadership is linked to adverse consequences, such as reduced motivation and productivity. The study asserts that comprehending and embracing the suitable leadership approach is crucial for augmenting employee performance and proficiency in higher education institutions. This research makes a significant addition by delivering a thorough analysis of how different leadership styles impact academic personnel may vary depending on the institutional context and organizational culture.

Design/methodology/approach: This study has analysed 417 publications from the Scopus database on collective leadership from 1967 to 2023. Data were analysed using MS Excel and VOSviewer. Findings: There has been research from different parts of the world on the various aspects of collective leadership. In recent years, collective leadership research has gained momentum. However, collective leadership is still at a nascent level when it comes to the applicability of the concepts. So far, the research on collective leadership has relied on themes such as shared leadership and distributed leadership, how collective leadership differs from other similar-looking leadership styles such as transformational leadership, and how this influences followers’ outcomes such as team effectiveness, achievements, relations, commitment, etc. Most of the research so far has been done in the United States of America, the UK and the Australian context. There exists a huge gap for studying collective leadership in African, Middle Eastern and Asian contexts.

The main problem and hypothesis of the present research is to argue that the Semiotics of Discourse (Paris School) can provide ʻpart ofʼ a comprehensive theoretical framework for conceptualizing coaching and its development as an academic discipline and subdiscipline. Therefore, adopting a descriptive-analytic method based on Fontanille's ideas (Fontanille, 2003, as translated by Bostic, 2006) in analyzing and solving a case study of one of her clients in coaching, and introducing the term ʻKhodnavardiʼ being established and registered in Iran by her, the author examines this problem and hypothesis. In order to make linguistics (its types and subdisciplines), semiotics (its types, and other fields intertwined with it), and other possible, probable fields, institutions, practitioners, skills, and sciences more practical, the current and future objective of this inquiry is to elementarily introduce the process of coaching discourse as an object and corpus of transdisciplinary studies. This trajectory will finally provide the context for the localization of the academic discipline, subdiscipline, and new profession of coaching, and subsequently coaching education and studies, and coaching training: A kind of localization, entrepreneurship and job creation. Pointing out the similarities between the Semiotics of Discourse (Paris School) and coaching, and presenting a model based on “Khodnavardi”, the main achievement of this inquiry is suggesting the basics of ʻSemiotic Coachingʼ at an academic level in Iran. In addition, ʻSemiotic Coachingʼ can lead to interactions or commonalities with other fields, institutions, practitioners, skills, and sciences including pragmatism, educational linguistics, edusemiotics, change, transformation, cognitive sciences, philosophy, sociology, psychology, teaching, communication, management, human and organizational resource development, leadership, literature, cinema and theater, etc., and on the other hand, with different types of coaching like linguistic, semantic, ontological, integral, existential, narrative, cognitive, clean language, core energy, neuro-linguistic, academic, developmental, emotional intelligence, and other topics which will not be addressed for the sake of brevity. © 2022, Tarbiat Modares University.

Strengthening the internal governance of the interdisciplinary entrepreneurial team in universities is an important measure to enhance the transformation of scientific and technological achievements in universities and boost the construction of the national innovation system. The interdisciplinary entrepreneurial team in universities is the source of the improvement of academic entrepreneurial performance, there is still a lack of systematic and comprehensive theoretical and empirical research on its internal governance. This paper takes interdisciplinary entrepreneurial teams in universities as the study object, analyzes the internal governance mechanism and laws of interdisciplinary entrepreneurial teams in universities theoretically and empirically, and finds that: Transformational leadership has positive impacts on interdisciplinary collaboration and academic entrepreneurial performance in interdisciplinary entrepreneurial teams in universities; Interdisciplinary collaboration plays a partial mediating effect in the relationship between transformational leadership and academic entrepreneurial performance; The relationship conflict in conflict plays both a negative and a positive moderating effect in the relationship between transformational leadership and the different dimensions of interdisciplinary collaboration. The task conflict in conflict has an insignificant negative moderating effect in the relationship between transformational leadership and the quality of collaboration in interdisciplinary collaboration. The findings of this paper emphasize the matching law of the materialization process of the productivity of interdisciplinary entrepreneurial teams in universities, and also provide evidence for the coupling of core elements in the internal governance process of interdisciplinary entrepreneurial teams in universities. The theoretical contribution of this paper are as follows: firstly, there has been controversy over the dimensions of transformational leadership in previous studies. This paper confirms that transformational leadership is a univariate variable and cannot be divided into different dimensions, indicating that there may be important situational elements in the dimension division of transformational leadership. Secondly, based on the interdisciplinary characteristics of interdisciplinary entrepreneurial teams in universities, this paper explores the integration of transformational leadership and interdisciplinary cooperation, two key governance elements that affect the growth and development of interdisciplinary entrepreneurial teams in universities, into the common research model. This not only expands the analytical framework for the performance of transformational leadership in academic entrepreneurial teams, but also systematically depicts and describes the internal governance mechanisms of interdisciplinary entrepreneurial teams in universities, this goes beyond the existing study framework on the separation of transformational leadership and interdisciplinary cooperation, it is an important supplement to both transformational leadership theory and interdisciplinary cooperation theory. Thirdly, this study finds that there are significant differences in the moderating effects of different dimensions of conflict in the relationship between transformational leadership and interdisciplinary cooperation, which breaks through the stereotype that relationship conflict always has a negative impact in previous studies, and is an important supplement to the conflict theory and the theory of competition and cooperation. The practical inspiration of this paper lies in: the paper focuses on the most important internal governance variable of the team - the key role of transformational leadership in the academic entrepreneurial performance of interdisciplinary entrepreneurial teams in universities. At the same time, this paper emphasizes that interdisciplinary cooperation is an important path to improve the internal governance performance of interdisciplinary entrepreneurial teams in universities. Moreover, the paper identifies the different roles that conflict plays in the process of transformational leadership leading interdisciplinary entrepreneurial team members in universities to engage in interdisciplinary cooperation. © 2024 Editorial Department of Studies in Science of Science.

Study Design: Cross-sectional national survey. Methods: Executive directors of community health centers (269 respondents; response rate = 40.9%) were surveyed regarding their perceptions of the medical director's leadership, and for quantitative information on the center's achievement of clinical (mostly disease management) goals. The dependent variables were the medical director's scores (as perceived by the executive director) on transformational, transactional, and laissez-faire leadership, effectiveness, satisfaction with the leader, and subordinate extra effort, using an adapted Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire (43 items; 5-point Likert scale). The independent variable was the medical director's management training status. Results: Compared with medical directors with <30 days of in-service training, medical directors with an MHA, MPH, or MBA, or ≥30 days of in-service training, had 0.32, 0.35, 0.30, 0.36, and 0.37 higher scores on transformational leadership, transactional leadership, rated effectiveness, satisfaction, and subordinate extra effort, respectively, and 0.31 lower score on laissez-faire leadership (all P < .001).

In particular, the past twenty years have witnessed an explosive growth of interest in what has been termed 'transformational leadership' (henceforth, TL). The theory is closely linked to the growth in what has been defined as corporate culturism - an emphasis on the importance of coherent cultures, as a means of securing competitive advantage. This article outlines the central components of TL theory, and subjects the concept to a critical analysis. In particular, similarities are identified between the components concerned and the characteristics of leadership practice in organizations generally defined as cults. This connection has been previously unremarked in the literature. These similarities are comprehensively reviewed. Trends towards what can be defined as corporate cultism in modern management practice are also discussed. We conclude that TL models are overly concerned with the achievement of corporate cohesion to the detriment of internal dissent. Such dissent is a vital ingredient of effective decision-making. It is suggested that more inclusive and participatory models of the leadership process are required.","",,"",,,"",""

In this paper, we argue that these ambivalent findings were due to the oversight of the indirect effects of ICT use mediated by other ICT-related variables. We employed multilevel structural equation modelling to unfold the relationship between students’ ICT use and their academic achievements based on PISA 2015 data. The results indicated that students’ autonomy in ICT use and students’ interest in ICT use were found to have significant positive direct effects on students’ academic achievements at both within-school and between-school levels. These two variables played a significant role in mediating the indirect effects of ICT use outside school for schoolwork and ICT resources on students’ academic achievements. On the contrary, ICT resources and ICT use at school exerted either no direct effect or a negative direct effect on students’ academic achievements and students’ perceived autonomy related to ICT use, suggesting that mere provision and use of ICT resources in school did not necessarily guarantee success in student performance.

Recently, in the field of education, efforts have been made to develop leadership in a pedagogical, distributed, and transformational manner in the management and teaching teams of institutions in order to improve learning outcomes. The academic community is influenced by an environment of intellectual, social, cultural, and technological development, which converts the beginning teacher into an active agent who must deal with a global reality of uncertain changes. In this context, the collaborative virtual learning environments are assumed as the optimum scenario to board the training and development of the future trainers at university level, generating a critical and reflexive attitude for their formation in the teaching/learning process. The motivation of this paper arises from these reflections with the purpose of analyzing the collaborative spaces in virtual environments as socio-cultural support for university beginning teachers. Based on a qualitative research with a documentary phase, a theoretical comparison was developed to generate analysis categories which allowed to perform a depth interview addressed to teachers from different countries of Latin America and the Caribbean involved in this training. Concerns and expectations emerged within the formative phase of the beginning teachers, characterized by the pursuit of learning processes that do not exist in their training plan to connect them to a virtual and collaborative reality.

Design/methodology/approach: Two hundred and thirty-five structured questionnaires were administered to the academic staff in five universities located in Northern Cyprus, and the data was analyzed using partial least square structural equation modeling with the aid of WarpPLS (7.0). Findings: This study provides evidences that green hard and soft TM exerts significant influence on employees’ innovative work behavior. Similarly, transformational leadership and artificial intelligence were confirmed to have a significant impact on employees’ innovative work behavior. Moreover, the study found transformational leadership and artificial intelligence to significantly moderate the relationship between green hard TM and employees’ innovative work behavior. Research limitations/implications: The study provides theoretical and managerial implications of findings that will assist the leaders in higher educational institutions in harnessing the potential of green TM in driving their employees’ innovative work behavior toward the achievement of sustainable competitive advantage in the market where they operate. Originality/value: The attention of researchers in the recent time has been on the way to address the challenge facing organizational leaders on how to develop and retain employee that will contribute to the sustainability of their organization toward the achievement of sustainable competitive advantage in the market they operate. Meanwhile, the studies exploring these concerns are limited. In view of this, this study investigates the significance of an emerging concept – green talent management and its influence on employees’ innovative work behavior, together with the moderating roles of transformational leadership and artificial intelligence within the context of higher educational institutions. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","",,"",,,"",""

Yet, the implementation of school-wide interventions is complex and can be psychologically taxing for implementing personnel. If evidence-based practice and program (EBP) implementation goes unsupported, implementation challenges might result in chronic stress among school personnel that leads to burnout. While generally effective leadership tends to decrease educator burnout, implementation-specific leadership may also decrease burnout through its strategic supports for EBP implementation. A series of linear regression and path models were used to examine the concurrent association between transformational (e.g., general) and implementation (e.g., strategic) leadership and burnout and its component parts (i.e., emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, personal accomplishment). In a sample of 338 school personnel, we found transformational and implementation leadership were each significantly associated with decreased burnout. However, transformational leadership was not significantly associated with any of the three burnout components, whereas implementation leadership was significantly associated with increased personal accomplishment. These results suggest both general and strategic forms of leadership are key supports for school personnel burnout and as such, leaders may benefit from training to improve each. Additional implications for schools and future directions to understand how best to support school personnel are discussed. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","",,"",,,"",""

In the most general form, the material is presented regarding the strategic guidelines for the quality of education in the WHE with special learning conditions in the context of Ukraine's integration into the European educational space. Philosophical and methodological approaches to solving existing disagreements in the field of human measurement of the quality of police education in Ukraine and abroad are studied in integral connection with the corresponding concepts of human development; leadership theories; the genesis of personnel work on professional training and evaluation of the activities of police officers in the system of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Ukraine. Features of the human-measurement training of officers of the National Police of Ukraine are explained on the basis of the provisions of the modern post-non-classical methodology of science, a general scientific holistic approach, humanistic pedagogy, as well as the methodological foundations for the implementation of international standards of ethical behavior in the activities of police officers, which is an objective need of the current Ukrainian education system in general and in particular, a prerequisite for the prevention of corruption offenses, the vitality of virtue in society. The productivity of reflexive practices of self-organization of the personality of future police officers is substantiated as a condition for the development of psychological resilience. The book proves the necessity and prospects of research and implementation in the theory and practice of police education of the concept of Ukrainian general scientific methodology regarding the unity of the formation and development of a Human on the basis of the cognitive-emotional-volitional triad of components of the value experience of the individual. Based on the real originality of the formation of the value experience of a police officer in the process of professional training, constructive practice, the general theoretical and methodological origins and meaningful lines of practical improvement and further personal and professional growth of a police officer in their official activities as mechanisms for protecting human rights and freedoms in the activities of law enforcement officers are identified. The novelty of the approaches is associated with the use of the key foundations of psychopedagogical support and the development of pedagogical skills of HEI teachers with special learning conditions, the activities of mentors to harmonize the professional training of the applicant's personality in the system of departmental education, the use of a criteria approach for assessing learning outcomes, the design features of police work programs in the context of the scale of human-dimensional meanings evaluating the quality of higher education The constructiveness of this perspective is distinguished, first of all, by a holistic combination and use as the latest achievements of the psychological, pedagogical, legal, neurophysiological branches of scientific knowledge to explain the newly formed pedagogical phenomena of the modern educational sphere in the aspect of innovativeness of markers for assessing the quality of educational and research activities education; and the understanding that universal human and nation-creating value orientations as a special social basis of the culturological worldview should be extrapolated into the global function of modern education, which should determine and realize its social power that characterizes civilizational development in different historical epochs. In this context, the issues of introducing the axiological essence, designing, implementing and evaluating the relevant educational programs for training officers of the National Police are specified. In general, the developments contained in this collective monograph will be suitable for use in the pedagogical and psychological support of educational activities for the training of police officers both in the framework of formal and non-formal education. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","",,"",,,"",""

Because implicit biases that stereotypically masculine behaviors are required for effective leadership remain strong, examining faculty members' perceptions of their chair's leadership in medical school departments with women chairs can provide insight into the views of women leaders in academic medicine and the complex ways in which gender may impact these chairs' leadership style and actions. Methods: We conducted semistructured interviews with 13 male and 15 female faculty members representing all faculty tracks in three clinical departments chaired by women. Inductive, qualitative analysis of the subsequent text allowed themes to emerge across interviews. Results: Four themes emerged regarding departmental leadership. One dealt with the leadership of the previous chair. The other three described the current chair's characteristics (tough, direct, and transparent), her use of communal actions to help support and mentor her faculty, and her ability to build power through consensus. Because all three chairs were early in their tenure, a wait and see attitude was frequently expressed. Faculty generally viewed having a woman chair as an indication of positive change, with potential individual and institutional advantages. Conclusions: This exploratory study suggests that the culture of academic medicine has moved beyond questioning women physicians' competence to lead once they are in top organizational leadership positions. The findings are also consonant with experimental research indicating that women leaders are most successful when they pair stereotypic male (agentic) behaviors with stereotypic female (communal) behaviors. All three chairs exhibited features of a transformational leadership style and characteristics deemed essential for effective leadership in academic medicine.

Design A large survey based on questionnaires developed from non-school organizations was used to develop a model to test the nature and strength of the relationships between variables and to understand the interactive nature of leadership and organizational learning and their effects on student outcomes. Model testing employed a latent variables partial least squares path analysis procedure. Findings The results of research have shown that leadership characteristics of a school are important factors in promoting systems and structures that enable the school to be effective and improve, in brief, to operate as a learning organization. School leaders need to be skilled in transformational leadership practices which work, directly and indirectly through others, towards bringing about: consensus in the organization’s mission; structures for shared decision making; continual learning through reflective practice; high standards of professionalism; and, a supportive and appreciative climate that promotes a culture of trust and collaboration. The LOLSO research also demonstrates that schools can be identified as learning organizations as they establish sequentially systems and structures of operation that promote: a collaborative and trusting work environment; a shared and monitored mission; empowerment of its members to share decision-making, show initiative and take risks; and, on-going challenging and relevant professional development. These school factors of leadership and organizational learning are shown to influence what happens in the core business of the school; the teaching and learning. Value The article answers two fundamental questions: Does the nature of the leadership and the level of organizational learning in schools contribute to school effectiveness and improvement in terms of the extent of students’ participation in school, student academic self-concept and engagement with school? What is the nature of the relationship between non-academic student measures of participation in school, student self-concept and engagement with school and measures of student retention and academic achievement?. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","",,"",,,"",""

Information and Communication Technology (ICT) leadership supports effective instructional practices through a combination of interpersonal skills, knowledge of a variety of current technology applications, and the vision to anticipate future technology-based solutions for education. The potential benefits of good ICT leadership can include improved academic achievement by students, improved student attendance and reduced attrition, better vocational preparation of students, more efficient administrative operations, and reduced teacher/staff burnout and turnover. The main objectives of this study are to investigate principals’ ICT leadership practices in their respective colleges and the methods and strategies principals use to lead technology integration into the educational environment. Qualitative as well as quantitative data were collected by means of semi-structured interviews and questionnaires that were administered to teachers and principals of professional colleges. This study reveals that technology integration as an instructional strategy needs to be learned in the wider context of changing pedagogy and paradigms of thought about technology use in education.

Drawing on Bandura’s social cognitive theory, a quantitative cross-sectional design was employed to collect data from 1,034 students at five different Chinese Higher Vocational Colleges. These findings indicate that transformational leadership positively affects student engagement and self-efficacy. Their sense of self-efficacy moderated the relationship between leadership and student involvement. This study adopted structural equation modeling, which confirms the proposed relationships’ robustness. However, some limitations, such as the cultural context and limited representativeness, should be considered for future studies. Policymakers and practitioners in education can use these findings to inform efforts to enhance vocational education instruction and student achievements. Implications for practice include suggestions for bettering programs that support teacher leadership and for including self-efficacy tests in educational policies to increase student involvement.

The role of collective efficacy on the relationship between transformational leadership of principals and self-efficacy of teachers was a special focus for the study. Design/methodology/approach: A causal comparative research design was employed to study the direct, indirect, and mediating relationships among principal leadership, teacher self-efficacy, and collective efficacy in schools.

A Latent Class Analysis of Principal Perception of Leadership,2014.0,1,1,,,,,,"Urick, A. and Bowers, A.J.",,,,,"Purpose: Effective styles of principal leadership can help address multiple issues in struggling schools, such as low student achievement and high rates of teacher attrition. Although the literature has nominated certain ""idealized"" leadership styles as being more or less effective, such as transformational, instructional, and shared instructional leadership, we have little evidence about how principals may or may not choose to practice these styles across U.S. schools. Research Design: Latent class analysis was used to identify different types of principals across the United States. We analyzed the 1999-2000 Schools and Staffing Survey as it presents a unique opportunity to study the different types of U.S. principals since it contains leadership measures not found in other national surveys. A final sample of 7,650 public schools and principals was included in the analysis. Findings: Instead of idealized leadership styles signifying variations in practice, the differences between types of principals were defined by the degree of principal and teacher leadership. Further, the school and principal context, such as school size, urbanicity, accountability performance, and principal background, predicted the three significantly different principal types: controlling, frequent principal leadership; balkanizing, high degree of leadership shared with teachers; or integrating, frequent principal leadership as well as a high degree of leadership shared with teachers. Conclusions: These types suggest that principals simultaneously practice leadership behaviors associated with multiple leadership styles in accordance with their background and school context.

Research has shown associations between TFL and various athlete outcomes in Western sports contexts. However, limited attention has been paid to how cultural factors shape these relationships in East Asian settings, particularly within Japanese sports culture that emphasizes hierarchical relationships and collectivist values. Methods: The study included 112 first-year undergraduate students from a sports science program at a Japanese university. Athletes' perceptions of their coaches' TFL behaviors and PYD outcomes were assessed using the Differentiated Transformational Leadership Inventory for Youth Sport (DTLI-YS) and the Youth Experience Survey for Sport (YES-S). Results: Correlation analyses revealed a particularly strong association between high performance expectations and initiative (r =.53, p <.01), notable when compared to American research where correlations between PYD outcomes and TFL dimensions were typically weaker (r =.11 –.43). Regression analyses further showed that high performance expectations were significantly associated with both goal setting (β =.29, p <.05) and initiative (β =.39, p <.01). Analysis by competition level revealed significant differences in initiative (F = 4.07, p <.01, η² =.10) and total YES-S scores (F = 2.75, p <.05, η² =.07). Discussion: These findings contribute to understanding how cultural context shapes the relationship between coaching leadership and youth development in sports. While the prominence of high performance expectations reflects Japanese sports culture's emphasis on discipline and collective achievement, results suggest the importance of incorporating a more balanced leadership approach that includes elements beyond high performance expectations to foster comprehensive athlete development. 2025 Nakayama and Izawa.","",,"",,,"",""
rayyan-304195327,Critical play: New paradigms for promoting student achievement and excellence,2016.0,1,1,,,,,,"Barber, W.",,,,,"In spheres beyond the student achievement literature, the notion of excellence includes consideration not only of the individual behaviors that represent excellence in action, but also the conditions or environments that foster or provide opportunities for growth in this direction. Unless the conditions for excellence to occur are present, this quality may remain inert. Emerging from this chapter is the concept of “critical playing."" Reaching beyond critical thinking, “critical playing” engages the learners’ physical, emotional, social, intellectual and spiritual selves. It is a qualitative state of excellence which can exist in both teachers and students, whereby individuals are deeply connected to themselves, the lesson content, and their interactions with others in a healthy school community. Authors have referred to this concept of “flow” to describe when students are performing at their potential (Csikzenmihalyi, 1980). Educational environments that nurture both “critical playing” and “flow” foster a rich environment to promote student achievement. This chapter suggests that there are individual and organizational factors which enhance the development of high performing students, by building a culture of achievement, thereby allowing these teachers to inspire critical playing, flow and excellence in their students. First, the notions of expertise and excellence in individual students are examined using Bereiter and Scardamalia’s (1993) research on expertise. Orlick’s (1992) Wheel of Excellence involves several key traits in the individual high performer which are indicators of excellence. These characteristics include “commitment, belief in oneself, full focus, distraction control, constructive evaluation, positive images and mental readiness” (p. 110). Orlick’s examination of high performers in many professional fields is comparable to the characteristics needed by students to excel. These characteristics needed to be successful are also reiterated by the Conference Board of Canada Employability Skills (2016) and the Davos World Conference (2015) on skills needed to excel for 2020. The second key element in this conceptual framework is an investigation of the organizational parameters which affect student excellence. Many authors have studied the primary factors which are considered to be indicators of a high-performing educational organization (Carter, 2002; Meehan, Wiersma, Cowley, Craig, Orletsky & Childers, 2002; Trimble, 2002; Cibulka & Nakayama, 2000). In this research, Cibulka and Nakayama’s (2000) work identifies some characteristics of high-performing schools, including a “collaborative culture, transformational leadership, reflective practice, an ethic of interpersonal caring, increasing standards of professional development, and accountability for high standards” (p. 23). A third critical element in this framework is the impact of health promoting schools on both student achievement and teacher performance. A great deal of research supports the idea that the characteristics of a healthy school are also key features of an institution which nurtures student and teacher excellence (Anderson, 2002; Laforet-Fleisser & Mitchell, 2002; Youngs, 1993; Anderson & Piran, 2001). Finally, the paper will address the integration of these themes as they are ubiquitously woven through the student-centred learning experience. Students are encouraged to strive for excellence if each of these three elements are present in the learning environment achievements. © 2017 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.","",,"",,,"",""

While local contexts will always be central to these choices, results of research ought to provide useful points of departure. But determining what relevant evidence recommends, local context aside, is far more difficult that the admonition to be ‘evidence informed’ seems to imply and the research community has offered few systematic solutions to the problem. This paper offers one possible solution, the calculation of ‘Power Indices’ using, for the purposes of illustration, evidence about the effects of a selected set of potential school improvement priorities (teachers’ emotions) on student learning, in combination with evidence about the effects on teacher emotions of a selected set of transformational leadership practices. Results argue for the value of a unique line of future research enabling school leaders to make choices about both school improvement priorities and how they might best pursue those priorities that systematically reflect the results of relevant evidence. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","",,"",,,"",""

While strong instruction, adult support, and inclusive cultures have been proven to mitigate a myriad of risk factors for historically marginalized groups of students, opportunity gaps continue to face young people of color, even in affluent suburban districts, where the appearance of a level playing field can lead educators to underestimate their role in building social capital in their students. High graduation rates notwithstanding, school leaders in suburban districts must be prepared to lead staff to understand the critical impact of disparities in preparation on the competitiveness of their students of color and firstgeneration students. They must seek to uncover critical differences in how opportunities are parceled out, address subtle barriers to access, resist the “opportunity hoarding” that works to maintain the status quo in many districts, and develop in staff the pedagogical and relational skills that engage students of color in the highest opportunities available to them. Though many school administrators may be White, middle class, and personally unfamiliar with some of the racial and socioeconomic challenges that face many suburban districts today, their effectiveness in eliminating achievement and opportunity gaps will hinge on their ability to prepare all students for competition on a playing field that remains anything but level. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.","",,"",,,"",""

However, research into the impact of such courses on identity formation of healthcare professionals is limited. This study investigates the influence of such programmes on graduates’ educational identities, practices and career progression. Informed by constructivist grounded theory (CGT), semi-structured interviews were conducted with 27 graduates (2008–2012) from one postgraduate programme, who were at different stages in their careers worldwide. The audio data were transcribed and analysed using a CGT approach. Participants enrolled in award-bearing medical education courses for various intrinsic and extrinsic reasons. The findings from this study highlight their development as educators, and educational researchers, leaders and learners, as their self-efficacy in educational practices and engagement in scholarly activities increased. Graduates attributed career progression to the qualification, with many being promoted into senior positions. They also described substantial performance attainments in the workplace. The findings contribute to understanding the complexity and nuances of educational identity formation of healthcare professionals. A qualification in medical education encouraged transformational changes and epistemological development as an educator.

This volume makes it very clear, however, that there is no one approach to standards-based reform and countries change – there is a danger in paying attention to its evolution and impact in only one context. That’s what makes this volume so valuable. Louis Volante has drawn together descriptions from a wide range of countries, all involved in large-scale reform and using standards and assessments as part of their process.

The instructional leadership model refers to the role and the functions of school leadership to employ different management tasks with regards to teaching and learning. Instructional leadership role includes (a) developing mission and goals, (b) managing the educational production function, (c) promoting an academic learning climate, and (d) developing a supportive work environment. Instructional leaders were described as leading from a combination of both expertise and charisma focused primarily on the improvement of student learning outcomes. The monograph, entitled Instructional Leadership and Effective Teaching and Learning and written by Nazmi Xhomara, is dedicated to school instructional leadership as an important factor that influences teaching and learning at school. In the first chapter, the author presents and analyzes educational leadership vs educational management, as well as models of educational leadership and management. The author argues on the importance of different leadership models, such as managerial leadership, transformational leadership, participative leadership, interpersonal leadership, transactional leadership, postmodern leadership, moral leadership, and contingent leadership. Chapters Two, Three, and Four shed light on instructional leadership and teaching and learning, understanding of instructional leadership, the concept and practice of instructional leadership, instructional school leadership and learning environment, attributes of instructional leaders, instructional excellence, instructional leadership time management, effective teaching and teachers, as well as teaching challenges and learning environment. Meanwhile, the author has analyzed constructivism, student intelligence, understanding of supervision, instructional collegial supervision, supervision approaches, understanding of evaluation of teaching and learning, teacher evaluation, and instructional observing instruments in chapters Five, Six, and Seven. Chapters Eight and Nine are focused especially on the research work of the relationships between instructional leadership and teaching, learning, and students' achievements, as well as on an empirical study designed and conducted in Albania as a case. Chapters Ten and Eleven are dedicated to instructional leadership preparation and the future of instructional leadership. As a conclusion, Xhomara indicates that principals are responsible for developing school climates and cultures that support the very best instructional practices. The new era of instructional leadership has predictably placed significant demands for accountability for student success and equity on the principal as well as for the university programs that prepare them.

Based on theory and job analysis, we observed the effects of five leaders' competencies (achievement orientation, problem analysis and problem solving, social sensitivity, influence, and integrity) on three indicators of effectiveness (perceived leader's effectiveness, leadership emergence, and team performance). Furthermore, we examined whether transformational leadership mediates these effects. We collected the data during an interuniversity student team competition. A total of 57 team leaders and 364 team members participated in the study. At the beginning of the competition, we measured the leaders' competencies through assessment centers. Each leader was assessed by 4 trained assessors in a one day long assessment center consisting of multiple individual and group model situations. After 6 months of teamwork, we measured the perceived leaders' effectiveness, leadership emergence and transformational leadership using questionnaires, and we estimated the teams' performance based on the ranking of the teams in the competition. The results show that leader achievement orientation is a significant predictor of perceived leader effectiveness, leadership emergence and team performance. The other four competencies do not predictieader effectiveness. There is no relation between competencies and transformational leadership; therefore, transformational leadership does not mediate the relation between competencies and effectiveness. The advantages of this study were that we obtained the data regarding the competencies and effectiveness from three different sources and that we measured competencies before the teamwork began. An average of more than 6 subordinates per leader ensures highly reliable evaluations of leaders' transformational leadership, perceived effectiveness and leadership emergence.

Findings: Among the conclusions arising from the study is that several of the most widely advocated models of effective educational leadership actually include many of the same practices. Conclusions: More attention by researchers, practitioners, and researchers needs to be devoted to the impact of specific leadership practices and less to leadership models. © The University Council for Educational Administration 2012.","",,"",,,"",""

A total of 199 teachers, who taught O-NET and PISA key subjects-45 teachers in English, 77 teachers in science, 77 teachers in math-from the five regions of Thailand representing small, medium, and large school size were recruited through a stratified sampling technique and were asked to rate their principal's transformational school leadership and own transformational classroom leadership. A Thai version of the transformational leadership questionnaire was developed, which consisted of a self-rating and a rater form. Partial Least Square Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) was employed to find the causal relationship, and ANOVA version SPSS 21 was used to compare the SLA among three different school sizes. The study found that transformational school leadership had direct effects on transformational classroom leadership, but transformational classroom leadership did not have a direct effect on English, science, and math teaching. The study also found that large schools had better students' learning achievement compared to small and medium-sized schools, and small-sized schools had the lowest average score in English, science, and math. Based on these new findings, the study made guidelines for the Thai Ministry of Education, Thai school principals, and Thai teachers. © Common Ground Research Networks, Danty James, Patreeya Kitcharoen, All Rights Reserved.","",,"",,,"",""

rayyan-304195385,Humanistic Leadership in Africa: A Relational Ideal of Maat,2024.0,1,1,,,,,,"Zoogah, B.D.",,,,,"The increasing view that “traditional, hierarchical views of leadership are less and less useful given the complexities of our modern world” (Lichtenstein et al., Emergence: Complexity and Organization 8:2–12, 2006) and the heightened level of complexity in Africa necessitate an understanding of leadership that is humanistic, the process by which an individual in a leadership role influences others to achieve desire goals through human-centred principles of trust, ethicality, compassion, and engagement. Humanistic leadership has been part of Africa since the pre-modern era (i.e., ancient Egypt) through the Maat philosophy. Maat is a philosophy of the people of ancient Kemet or black Egypt. It “is a fundamental, pervasive, and enduring element in ancient Egyptian civilization and an inclusive and defining cultural category” (Karenga, Maât. The moral ideal in ancient Egypt: A study in classical African ethics, Routledge, 2004). Such leadership is particularly significant in this era of the Africa Union Agenda 2063, which views one of the critical success factors for the achievement of the agenda as “leadership and political commitment with transformational and visionary qualities at all levels and in all fields.” This view is also encapsulated in the World Economic Forum which indicates that “Africa doesn’t need charity, it needs good leadership.” In addition, the Mo Ibrahim Foundation, advocates effective leadership in Africa, established an award for good national leaders and a proprietary index that gauges the quality of governance and leadership in African countries (Mo Ibrahim Foundation, Governance progress in Africa stalling, reports Mo Ibrahim, 2015). This award has not been won in eight of the twelve years because no leader has been found worthy of the award. The chapter integrates historical, anthropological, and philosophical accounts of leadership in Africa to situate humanistic leadership in modern Africa. The framework is limited to the period before the colonial eras of Africa (i.e., the Kemetic era). Following a brief review of extant leadership in Africa, I discuss the Maatian view of humanistic leadership. Leveraging that historical perspective, I discuss exemplars of humanistic leaders in modern Africa. Three such leaders are Nelson Mandela (Glad and Blanton, Presidential Studies Quarterly 27:565–590, 1997; Pietersen, Leader to Leader 2015:60–66, 2015), Desmond Tutu (Blankstein et al., Excellence through equity: Five principles of courageous leadership to guide achievement for every student. ASCD, 2016), James Mwangi of Equity Bank of Kenya (Chironga et al., Leadership lessons from Africa’s trailblazers. McKinsey Quarterly, 1–10, 2019). While Nelson Mandela and Desmond Tutu epitomize the Ubuntu principles of humanism, James Nwangi exemplifies the Maatian humanistic principles. Both the traditional or ancient view of humanistic leadership which is illustrated with modern leaders affords an opportunity for scholars conducting research on humanistic leadership in Africa to ground their studies in Indigenous philosophical and humanistic principles. Humanistic leadership is proposed as a function of decisions and actions of African traditional orientations that derive from Maat philosophy. This perspective unearths the source of modern understanding of humanistic leadership and reorients the field of leadership development and prevention of bad leadership as they relate to management of organizations in Africa. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.","",,"",,,"",""

This study is a qualitative study with an interactive analysis model on transformational leadership strategies at the international Madrasah Aliyah Amanatul Ummah Mojokerto and the Serpong Insan Cendekia State Madrasah Aliyah. This study concluded that the first strategy to increase the influence of the idealism of the madrasah principal towards an international pesantren-based Madrasah Aliyah is the strong commitment between the principal and teachers, employees, students, as well as parents, beginning with planning (RKM) using school review, quality assurance, benchmarking, and quality control accompanied by exemplary values, an effort to maintain mutual trust as well as the sincerity of all stakeholders. Then, the second strategy is to foster inspirational motivation for the principals of international pesantren-based Madrasah Aliyah which is reflected in the ability of madrasah principals who can motivate and inspire their subordinates to improve the quality of education together. For example, the achievement of madrasah principals, teachers and students winning the international olympiad between 2010-2020 is supported by the principle of Islamic boarding school that is ‘The Islamic Role Model is The First Key to Build Great Leaders’. Furthermore, The third strategy is to strengthen the intellectual stimulus of Madrasah Aliyah’s principal with superior international standards based on Islamic boarding school values, which is reflected in several positive changes made and achieved by the madrasah’s principal, both the quality of the input, process, and output, such as student achievements in national and international levels such as scholarships to the Middle East, Europe, Japan, and Australia. Finally, the last strategy is to transform the madrasah principal’s individualized considereation towards superior international pesantren-based Madrasah Aliyah which is reflected in the ability of madrasah principals in managing human resources appropriately, including managing the right competencies for human resources through the competency development programs for teachers and employees continuously; and improving abilities through training supported by the principles of responsibility and exemplary, which are the characteristics of pesantren. © 2021","",,"",,,"",""

Australian early childhood education and care (ECEC) has its roots in philanthropic and educational reform movements prevalent at the turn of the twentieth century. More recently, with the introduction of the National Early Childhood Reform Agenda, early childhood education has once more been linked to the achievement of aims associated with redressing inequality and disadvantage. The authors argue that educational leaders have an obligation to promote equity as they articulate the needs of marginalised students who are traditionally disadvantaged while they also work towards challenging the social order that affords this circumstance of inequity to exist. Drawing on extant literature, including data from two previously reported Australian studies in which leadership emerged as having a transformational impact on service delivery, this article examines the potential of early childhood leadership to generate 'socially just' educational communities. With reference to critical theory, the authors argue that critically informed, intentional and strategic organisational leadership can play a pivotal role in creating changed circumstances and opportunities for children and families. Such leadership includes positional and distributed elements, articulation of values and beliefs, and collective action that is mindful and informed.","",,"",,,"",""

As a result, researchers seldom explore how well their models predict the outcomes they care about using best-practice approaches to predictive statistics. In this paper, we focus less on explanation and more on prediction, showing how both are important for advancing the field. We apply predictive models to the role of teachers on student engagement, i.e. the thoughts, attitudes, and behaviours, that translate motivation into progress. We integrate the suggestions from four prominent motivational theories (self-determination theory, achievement goal theory, growth mindset theory, and transformational leadership theory), and aim to identify those most critical behaviours for predicting changes in students’ engagement in physical education. Students (N = 1324 all from year 7, 52% girls) from 17 low socio-economic status schools rated their teacher’s demonstration of 71 behaviours in the middle of the school year. We also assessed students’ engagement at the beginning and end of the year. We trained elastic-net regression models on 70% of the data and then assessed their predictive validity on the held-out data (30%). The models showed that teacher behaviours predicted 4.39% of the variance in students’ change in engagement. Some behaviours that were most consistently associated with a positive change in engagement were being good role models (β = 0.046), taking interest in students’ lives outside of class (β = 0.033), and allowing students to make choices (β = 0.029). The influential behaviours did not neatly fit within any single motivational theory. These findings support arguments for integrating different theoretical approaches, and suggest practitioners may want to consider multiple theories when designing interventions. More generally, we argue that researchers in educational psychology should more frequently test how well their models not just explain, but predict the outcomes they care about. © 2023, Crown.","",,"",,,"",""

The literature review discusses aspects of leadership theory to elucidate understanding of how leadership influences teachers’ working relationships. Quantitative methodology and analyses ascertain the correlation between Leithwood et al.’s dimensions of transformational leadership and the author’s dimensions of teacher social capital. Study findings indicate significant, positive moderate to high moderate correlations between: (1) transformational leadership and the environmental conditions nurturing teacher social capital; (2) leadership and teacher social capital; and (3) leadership and teacher collective efficacy (TCE). An additional major finding is the perception of higher levels of transformational leadership among teachers in middle performing and high performing schools as compared to the perceptions of teachers in low performing schools. This study provides evidence of the importance of transformational leadership in the development of teacher social capital within a school. High levels of teacher social capital should result in positive outcomes of student achievement, teacher quality and teacher job satisfaction.

Case overview/synopsis: In “Cultural Collisions: The Struggle for Recognition in a Cross-Cultural Workplace,” Alex Brown, the National Marketing Head at ShowVista, faces mounting frustration as his contributions to the company’s success go unrecognized. Despite spearheading innovative marketing strategies that boosted revenue, Brown finds himself sidelined in an organization where hierarchy, consensus-driven decision-making and relationship-based leadership take precedence over individual achievement. ShowVista’s Indian-influenced corporate culture clashes with Brown’s results-oriented, recognition-driven mindset, leaving him isolated and undervalued. His attempts to implement data-driven approaches are met with resistance, while credit for his successes is often attributed to senior executives. The strain of navigating an unfamiliar work culture, compounded by personal sacrifices, forces Brown to question his future at the company. As he stands at a crossroads, he must decide whether to adapt to ShowVista’s norms or seek an organization that aligns with his values. The case examines the complexities of cultural fit, leadership role in a multicultural organization and career identity in a global workplace.

It creates problems for schools, which eventually leads to substandard instruction and low student achievement. This research explores the causes of English teachers’ turnover in a Non-Government Educational Organization in Kabul, Afghanistan. The results indicate that lack of teachers’ motivation, low salary, communication gap between management and teachers, market opportunities for English teachers, workload, absence of career path and weak recruitment processes are the major factors contributing to teachers’ turnover in Afghanistan. The high teachers’ turnover leads to such negative effects as interruptions in learning process, behavioural adjustment of students with new teachers, continuous exposure of students with novice teachers, emotional detachments of students with their teachers and negative effects on students’ learning. The article concludes that educational organizations should deal with their teachers more humanely. Teachers retain and perform in an organization when they are valued, motivated and satisfied with their jobs and their professional status. In the absence of such environment, it is likely that educational organizations in Afghanistan would continue to struggle to attract and retain qualified teachers, which will eventually compromise on the achievements of their students. Considering the findings, creation of covenantal bond rather than contractual bond is suggested as a strategy that could be augmented by a transformational leadership, which can motivate the teachers to remain committed to their profession. © The Author(s) 2015.","",,"",,,"",""

The impact of school leadership may be even more pronounced in charter schools. Due to current and unprecedented growth, unique design, and complexities of political, financial, and governance issues they face, there is a need for more highly qualified charter school leaders and perhaps even “differently” prepared leaders. In this qualitative study, the authors documented the characteristics and skills of two successful, sustained charter school leaders who retrospectively described their evolved and evolving roles over twenty five years. Each transformed high-poverty, low-performing schools with at-risk populations and led with vision, passion, and a relentless desire to positively influence their organizations and ultimately improve student success in their communities. Although many of their skills and characteristics fall within existing theories, such as situational leadership, transformational leadership, and distributive leadership, they embodied a level of dedication and commitment to the original communities in which they founded charters lasting over a quarter of a century. The findings suggest that founding a charter school and seeing it through to success over time may more closely resemble missionary work than traditional school leadership. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis.","",,"",,,"",""

rayyan-304195409,Leading Change and Innovation in Teacher Preparation: A Blueprint for Developing TPACK Ready Teacher Candidates,2013.0,1,1,,,,,,"Thomas, T. and Herring, M. and Redmond, P. and Smaldino, S.",,,,,"When preparing TPACK ready teacher candidates, faculty must incorporate and model TPACK within the teacher education curriculum, which often requires an ongoing change process. But for change to take place we must consider the role leadership plays in the innovation of change. Leaders, deans and department heads must be an integral part of this process. The challenge for innovation, change and education technology leaders is to transform teacher preparation programs into fully realized TPACK environments and determine the necessary learning opportunities and support necessary to motivate college leaders and faculty to fully embrace the change process. This article outlines a collaborative ongoing process and blueprint that leaders should consider as they make plans for the effective integration of TPACK into their colleges. ""Tomorrow's teachers must be prepared to rethink, unlearn and relearn, change, revise, and adapt"" (Niess, 2008, p.225). Leaders, deans and department heads must be an integral part of this process if it is to be successful.While technology can support changes in how teacher educators teach and future teachers learn to teach (Dilworth et al., 2012), teaching with technology is a ""wicked problem"" in that it has ""incomplete, contradictory and changing requirements"" (Koehler & Mishra, 2008, p.10). New and innovative ways of confronting this complexity must address core knowledge base components that include content, pedagogy, and technology. These components have been used as the foundation for a technology,pedagogy, andcontent knowledge(TPACK) framework known as technological pedagogical content knowledge, or TPCK (AACTE, 2008; Koehler & Mishra, 2008; Mishra & Koehler, 2006; Pierson, 1999). But what is the role of leaders where TPACK based processes are being implemented in university teacher preparation programs?Educational technology leaders often approach models for teacher preparation in collectives that examine them iteratively. The 2012 National Technology Leadership Summit brought together the American Association of Colleges for Teacher Education (AACTE) and its Innovation and Technology Committee. Representatives from college administrations met and examined leadership issues facing deans, directors and chairs as they work to support college-wide change facilitating faculty and teacher candidates in the task of becoming TPACK proficient. This work built upon a CITE (Contemporary Issues in Technology and Teacher Education) journal editorial focused on initial conversations around leadership needs for effective TPACK implementation (Dexter, Herring, & Thomas, 2012). A presentation at AACTE 2013 extended this work with teacher preparation and education technology leaders sharing ""what worked"" in their colleges around these processes. A panel presentation at the 2013 Society for Information Technology and Teacher Education (SITE) Conference also shared insights into a blueprint for key areas that leaders should consider as they make plans for the effective integration of TPACK into their colleges as well as several implementation case studies. This article compiles this iterative work from a leadership perspective.While the challenge is to transform teacher preparation programs into fully realized TPACK environments, leadership becomes the key in developing new ways of confronting this complex issue that must address core knowledge base components inclusive of content, pedagogy and technology. To accomplish this task, faculty are faced with incorporating modeling these ideas within a teacher education curriculum in concert with ongoing change processes. A solid understanding of the interactions of these components can result in effective teaching with technology in varied and diverse settings; but the critical role of leadership in making such changes must first be considered.The critical features of a blueprint for leaders is based upon the work of Leithwood and colleagues' framework comprised of three key leadership functions associated with improved student outcomes (Day, Sammons, Leithwood, Kington, 2008; Leithwood, Harris & Hopkins, 2008; Leithwood & Jantzi, 2008; Leithwood & Riehl, 2003). The three major component of the Leithwood transformational leadership model are: (1) Building vision and setting direction (2) Developing people through understanding people and (3) Developing the organization through redesigning it.Leithwood, Begley and Cousins (1994) define transformational leadership as follows:The term 'transform' implies major changes in the form, nature, function and/or potential of some phenomenon; applied to leadership, it specifies general ends to be pursued although it is largely mute with respect to means. From this beginning, we consider the central purpose of transformational leadership to be the enhancement of the individual and collective problem-solving capacities of organizational members; such capacities are exercised in the identification of goals to be achieved and practices to be used in their achievement (p. 7).Transformational leaders can create significant change in both followers and the organization with which they are associated (Griffin, 2003). Transformational leaders also find common ground that allows them to enlist followers in processes of change. Fullan (2010) finds that for true reform to take place, resolute leadership that remains focused is critical when new ideas encounter serious difficulty, thereby sustaining and building on success.To achieve this task and create significant change, transformational education leaders realize that true technology integration means understanding and negotiating the relationships between the three components of knowledge and going beyond a ""business"" organizational model to create change in teacher preparation programs. Too often organizations start down the road to change without being clear on key factors that influence the outcomes of the initiative. Deans and educational leaders must develop a model for change based upon both the organizational culture and the environments they need a set of resources to help and guide them to integrate a framework like TPACK. Through ongoing collaboration and discussion the focus has been around the development of a leadership module which would help leaders establish a vision and set a direction for addressing TPACK. The purpose of a leadership module would be to provide Deans and other educational leaders with the tools they need for full-scale implementation and motivate them to redesign their programs while continuing to improve and sustain a developing / changing curriculum. © 2013 Association for Educational Communications and Technology.","",,"",,,"",""

This paper begins by examining the merit of teaching evaluations with reference to the factors influencing the accuracy of the teaching evaluation process. One of the central assumptions on which student evaluation of teaching is based is that there is a relationship between student achievement and student rating of teachers. However, the findings of the majority of studies do not support this assumption. The absence of a strong link between student achievement and teaching evaluations suggests that there is scope for examining other approaches to measuring effective classroom dynamics. This paper presents such an approach based on the notion of transformational classroom leadership. © 2008 Taylor & Francis.","",,"",,,"",""

Transactional leadership consists of planning, implementation, and evaluation. Transformational leadership consists of charisma, intellectual stimulation, and individualized consideration that can motivate followers. The six orientations that characterize the Catholic healthcare ministry imply both types of leadership. Fundamental values, knowledge, and skills required for healthcare organization management are acquired through health administration education. The themes prevalent in today's Catholic healthcare ministry and the leadership qualities they imply are addressed by all aspects of such education: degree programs, field experience, continuing education, and research and consultation. Much of a master's degree program concentrates on transactional leadership because its content is better formulated and easier to teach. The development of transformational leadership qualities during master's study primarily provides a foundation on which students can build. Health administration programs in cooperation with healthcare organizations have created three models for field experience: internships, residencies, and fellowships. Many master's programs deliver continuing education programs for both types of leadership, and research and consultation contribute to this education.","",,"",,,"",""

Teachers may well thus benefit from developmental coaching that draws on theories of leadership. This study was both an experimental (randomly assigned conditions) and a quasi-experimental (pre-post) study. A randomized controlled design was used to explore the impact of coaching on goal attainment, mental health, workplace well-being, and resilience, and a quasi-experimental (pre-post) design was used to explore the impact of coaching on leadership styles. Forty-four high school teachers were randomly assigned to either coaching or a waitlist control group. The coaching used a cognitive-behavioral, solution-focused approach and was informed by theories of self-leadership and transformational leadership. Participants in the coaching group received multirater feedback on their leadership style and undertook 10 coaching sessions conducted by professional coaches over a 20-week period. Compared with randomly allocated controls, participation in coaching was associated with increased goal attainment, reduced stress, and enhanced workplace well-being and resilience. Pre-post analyses for the coaching group indicated that coaching enhanced self-reported achievement and humanistic-encouraging components of constructive leadership styles and reduced self-reported aggressive/defensive and passive/defensive leadership styles. Findings suggest that coaching, as a professional development methodology, has great potential to contribute to the development and well-being of society beyond the corporate and organizational settings with which leadership coaching and executive coaching are normally associated. © 2010 American Psychological Association.","",,"",,,"",""

Interviews with staff and students, together with classroom observation, confirm that the head, appointed in 1995, has played an important role in transforming internal processes and in changing the context of the school. Although the observed and reported behaviour of leaders, teachers, and students matches expectations from the literature, the consequences for student achievement are unclear. Background variables seem to explain most of the apparent improvement in student outcomes. An effectiveness framework that assigns disproportionate value to examination results seems to have created a leadership paradox, where heads reported to be transformational produce only limited gains in performance. The study concludes that the government's determination to assume a strongly positive relationship between leaders and outcomes has compromised the principle of evidence-informed policy-making and that we need a different approach based on a broadly defined, qualitative conception of student success.","",,"",,,"",""

Unless those of us who are committed to the study of supervision in higher education, as well as school administrators and other practitioners who supervise teachers, are ready, willing and able to assert responsibilities for best practice in supervision through transformational leadership the educational landscape will remain in its transitory and vulnerable state, inconsequential at best, destructive at worst. Relying on the social and educational critiques of Robert Goldhammer and Jules Henry, this article seeks to raise the consciousness of those committed to instructional excellence by offering insights into ways supervision can serve to enhance teachers' dignity, impact student learning and transform our work, and even schools themselves, so that vulnerability turns into possibilities and stagnation into transformation.","",,"",,,"",""

This study aimed to identify the latent profiles of head nurses’ ethical competence and examine differences in transformational leadership across latent profiles. Methods: Convenience sampling was used to recruit 329 head nurses from four tertiary hospitals in Changsha, Hunan province, China. This study collected data by using social-demographic survey, Ethical Competence Questionnaire, and Head Nurse’s Transformational Leadership Self-rating Scale between July and August 2023. Latent profile analysis (LPA) was employed to identify latent profiles of ethical competency. One-way ANOVA test and the Kruskal–Wallis test were used to compare the transformational leadership scores across latent profiles of ethical competency. Results: The mean scores of ethical competence and transformational leadership were 4.045 ± 0.394 and 4.555 ± 0.419, respectively. This study identified three latent profiles of head nurses’ ethical competence, and those profiles labelled “low ethical competence” (n = 60, 18.2%), “moderate ethical competence” (n = 217, 66.0%) and “high ethical competence” (n = 52, 15.8%). The average score of transformational leadership was also statistically different (F = 26.446, p = 0.000) across the three profiles.

Therefore, this study explored leadership styles and leadership outcomes of head nurses and directors of nursing (DoN) in nursing homes based on well-defined leadership concepts. Methods: A multicenter cross-sectional analysis was conducted on baseline data of an ongoing cohort study comprising a convenience sample of nursing home staff (n = 302). Leadership styles and leadership outcomes of head nurses and DoN were measured through the rater form of the Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire 5X (MLQ-5X). Based on the Full Range of Leadership Model, the MLQ-5X visualizes transformational (relation and change focused), transactional (task-focused) and passive-avoidant (absence of leadership) leadership styles. Scores of head nurses and DoN for leadership styles and outcomes were compared with European Reference Scores (ERS) using two-sided one-sample t-tests. Results: Compared with ERS, head nurses and DoN scored significantly lower (p < 0.001) on transformational and transactional leadership styles and significantly higher (p < 0.001) on passive-avoidant leadership styles. All leadership outcomes were significantly lower (p < 0.001) for head nurses. Similar results, however not statistically significant, were found concerning leadership outcomes of DoN. Conclusions: Results indicate that passive-avoidant leadership styles are excessively present in contrast to transformational leadership styles in nursing homes.

A critical question arises: Are prospective teachers adequately prepared to adapt to these evolving demands with the necessary competencies? This study addresses this question by investigating the effectiveness of an Integrated Learning Model (ILM) in enhancing key teaching competencies. The research focuses on teaching skills, analytical thinking abilities, academic integrity, and transformational leadership qualities among prospective teachers. The study employs an experimental research design, utilizing a one-group pre-test-post-test methodology to assess the impact of the ILM on 35 students selected through cluster sampling. Data collection instruments included the TPOG for evaluating teaching skills, the ATSI for assessing analytical thinking, the PAAIS-24 for measuring academic integrity, and the GTLS for gauging transformational leadership abilities. The data analysis involved descriptive statistics, paired samples t-tests, and N-gain score analysis. The results indicate a significant positive effect of the ILM on all measured competencies: teaching skills, analytical thinking skills, academic integrity, and transformational leadership. These findings underscore the ILM's potential as a robust framework for developing the competencies necessary for prospective teachers to meet the challenges of modern education. The study suggests that future research should explore the application of ILM in various social contexts, examine its effectiveness in fostering additional relevant competencies, and compare its outcomes with those of other instructional models.

The lack of clinical leadership is alarming given the detrimental effects on patient safety. The objective of the study was to assess whether a leadership training addressing transactional and transformational leadership enhances leadership skills in residents. Methods: A volunteer sample of 57 residents from postgraduate year one to four was recruited across a range of medical specialties. The residents took part in an interventional controlled trial. The four-week IMPACT leadership training provided specific strategies for leadership in the clinical environment, addressing transactional (e.g. active control, contingent reward) and transformational leadership skills (e.g. appreciation, inspirational motivation). Transactional and transformational leadership skill performance was rated (1) on the Performance Scale by an external evaluator blinded to the study design and (2) self-assessed transformational and transactional leadership skills. Both measures contained items of the Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire, with higher scores indicating greater leadership skills. Results: Both scores were significantly different between the IMPACT group and the control group.

Objectives: This paper describes quantitative pre-post findings from the Kouzes and Posner Student Leadership Practices Inventory to examine students' leadership attributes pre-post engagement in an 18. month undergraduate leadership program. Design: This is a non-experimental convenience study that used a quantitative pre-post survey design collecting data from participants and observers using the 360 Kouzes and Posner Student Leadership Practices Inventory. Settings: A private university in the northeastern region of the United States. Participants: Fourteen junior level nursing students who concurrently participated in a leadership program while concurrently completing their required academic courses for their bachelor's degree in nursing. Methods: Paired sample t-tests were used to determine if there was statistical significance among student participants' and observers' perceptions of specific leadership behaviors and skills of students at the onset (pretest) and at the conclusion (posttest) of the leadership program. Results: Participant and observer scores were positively correlated and statistical significance was identified in several practice areas.

Design/methodology/approach: Schein's Descriptive Index was used in this study. A total of 1,236 surveys were included in the study. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC, r1) were computed to determine the relationship between the different moderators and requisite managerial characteristics. Factorial analysis and agglomerative hierarchal cluster analysis were used to identify the traits attributed to men, women and managers. Findings: Male respondents continue to gender type the managerial role in favour of men. Both males and managers continue to be viewed as agentic in nature while women are viewed in more androgynous terms by both male and female respondents. Practical implications: This study expands our understanding of how males and females view women, men and managers.

However, empirical studies have coded vision statements in noncomparable ways. To measure the content of vision statements, the present study demonstrates the application of the motive coding methodology developed by McClelland and Winter. Using two independent samples of vision statements, we further demonstrate the applicability of this methodology by testing for expected relationships between vision statements and individual, unit, and organizational performance. Half of the expected relationships yielded significant results. Nevertheless, motive imagery measures yielded reliable scores, were feasible to apply, and provided relevant measures of vision statement content. This methodology has the potential to allow researchers to test charismatic/transformational leadership theory in new ways and to provide leaders with concrete guidance about the content of their vision statements.

In previous research higher levels of emotional intelligence have been found to be associated with more transformational leadership; thus the present study also seeks to examine whether higher emotional intelligence makes individuals more receptive to self-efficacy-based leadership training. Design/methodology/approach: The study used an experimental design. Participants were randomly assigned to either a self-efficacy expressive writing condition or a control writing condition. Participants were 118 managers who completed measures of self-efficacy, transformational leadership and emotional intelligence at the start of the study and again completed measures of self-efficacy, and transformational leadership after the intervention. Findings: Managers in the intervention condition showed significantly greater transformational leadership self-efficacy and higher transformational leadership scores than the control group managers at post-test. Further, those higher in emotional intelligence were more responsive to the intervention. Practical implications: The intervention holds promise as a low cost and easy to implement method of facilitating development of transformational leadership. Originality/value: The finding that an intervention aimed at increasing self-efficacy can increase transformational leadership extends previous research on both self-efficacy and transformational leadership. This result suggests that leadership self-efficacy may be an important component of transformational leadership. The finding that individuals higher in emotional intelligence benefited most from the intervention extends previous findings regarding the importance of emotional intelligence in organisational settings. Emotional intelligence may facilitate individuals' openness to change. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","",,"",,,"",""

Cluster variables from both industries included in the analysis are as follows: Idealized influence, inspiring motivation, intellectual stimulation, and individualized consideration are all components of leadership. Theoretical Framework: Due to its apparent efficacy, transformational leadership has received a lot of attention from public sector researchers over the past decade. Successful leaders alter their teams by enlisting their followers' help in effecting change. A transformational leader is one who ""transforms"" their followers by inspiring them to make positive personal and professional shifts. Design / Methodology / Approach:The study is exploratory research design using Quantitative data collected from the Banking and Insurance sector employees. The study uses a well-structured questionnaire using Likert scale items. The sample was chosen on Convenience basis from 5 select public sector Insurance companies and 5 select public sector Insurance companies. 100 Questionnaires each were distributed and 97 valid responses were selected for banking industry and 90 responses from Insurance Industry were selected for the study. Paired t test using SPSS software was utilised for analysing the data in the study. Findings:The findings of the study show that there is significant difference between the leadership styles practices in Banking and Insurance industry. The banking sector employees showed a greater inclination towards transformational leadership with higher mean scores and statistically significant outcomes. Research Implications: Banking and insurance each have their own distinct cultures and management philosophies; as a result, they cannot be studied as a single entity under the umbrella of the BFSI sector. Additional research on the various leadership styles currently in use within the banking and insurance sectors is necessary.

Design/methodology/approach: This research was conducted in South Africa, in a variety of organisations, and by sampling employees across three generations, namely millennials, Generation X and baby boomers. Cross-sectional data were collected with an instrument based on the Pearce leadership typology of leadership styles. After confirming reliability and general factorial validity, mean scores were compared using analyses of variance. Findings/results: The results of the study found practically significant differences between millennial leaders and Generation X leaders in the extent to which they apply empowering and transformational leadership styles, as perceived by their subordinates. In absolute terms, millennial leaders display less leadership behaviour than do those of Generation X, with regard to these leadership approaches. Practical implications: Organisations involved in the development of millennial leaders should be aware that interventions should not blindly align to the stereotypes associated with this generation. Further research is also needed to determine which leadership styles are effective with millennial leaders. Originality/value: The millennial generation has emerged in the workplace as the new leadership pipeline, yet there appears to be a lack of research on how millennials want to lead.

The three academic libraries were chosen based on the fact that two of the universities were residential research-intensive universities and the third was an academic library of a distance learning university. Design/methodology/approach: The study adopted a quantitative approach with a survey design in three academic libraries in the Gauteng province in South Africa in which a close-ended questionnaire yielded quantitative data. The study included 29 academic staff from the rank of assistant librarian to the director from the three academic libraries, as these are the personnel in leadership positions. To code and analyse, quantitative data from a Likert scale, SPSS version 25 was used. Cronbach's alpha was used to evaluate the instrument's reliability on the five constructs used in this study to determine readiness to adopt a transformational leadership style. The overall level of internal consistency exceeded the theoretical minimum of 70 percent. The Shapiro-Wilk test was used to determine the normality of the data and the p values were greater than 0.05 (p > 0.05). Tables have been used to present descriptive and inferential statistics based on data. Findings: Participants expressed favourable opinions about academic libraries' ability to learn from the best practices of others in the profession, with mean scores greater than 3.5 on a 5.0 scale. Participants' perceptions of transformative versus traditional management styles yielded a moderate mean score of 3.0, with moderate mean scores ranging from 2.8 to 3.3. The average score for talent identification and succession planning in academic libraries was 3.5. Perceptions of leadership responsibilities had a mean score of 4.1, with attributes on leadership responsibilities scoring at least 3.5. Perceptions of problems for the next generation of leaders in academic libraries were moderate, with a mean score of 3.2 on a scale of 5.0. Research limitations/implications: Only three of the seven public university libraries in the Gauteng province in South Africa were surveyed in this study. The sample size was reasonably small for generalizations beyond the South African Gauteng province academic libraries. However, it was felt useful for this particular case. A survey of all 26 South African public universities is required to assess transformational leadership traits in academic libraries. Practical implications: Next-generation leaders in South African academic libraries are perceived as not being aggressive in terms of team building, coaching and motivating others. Social implications: In the wake of COVID-19, new leadership traits such as scenario planning are needed for academic libraries. Originality/value: Leadership studies abound in the library and information studies (LIS) profession and they are not new. However, research on transformational leadership in South African libraries is still in its early stages. As a result, this study fills a gap in the literature on transformative leadership in academic libraries in South Africa. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","",,"",,,"",""

Thus, it is essential to examine the factors associated with clinical competency. Purpose This study was designed to (a) investigate head nurse leadership, staff nurse demographics, and clinical competency; (b) examine the impact of demographics on the clinical competency of staff nurses; (c) analyze the correlation between head nurse leadership and staff nurse clinical competency; and (d) examine the effects of demographics on clinical competency after controlling for the head nurse leadership. Methods A cluster sampling method was used to collect data from 200 staff nurses at a national medical center in Taiwan. Questionnaires were used to gather information on head nurse leadership style and staff nurse clinical competency. Descriptive and inferential statistical analyses were conducted, including Mann-Whitney U test, Kruskal-Wallis test, Spearman's rank correlation coefficient, and multivariate analysis of covariance. Results The average score for transformational leadership style among the head nurses was 2.89, whereas transactional leadership style scored an average of 2.49. The average scores for the components of clinical competency, listed from highest to lowest, were as follows: patient care (3.35), professionalism (3.28), communication skills (3.18), management (2.84), and knowledge (2.73). In addition, statistically significant differences were found in clinical competency based on demographic factors, including age, marital status, educational level, job title, and length of employment. Also, a statistically significant, positive correlation between the head nurse transformational leadership style and nurse clinical competency was found. The main effect of length of employment on the five competency components was statistically significant after controlling for transformational leadership. Furthermore, post hoc analysis of covariance revealed a significant effect of length of employment on patient care, knowledge, communication skills, and management. Conclusions The findings of this study indicate transformational leadership and employment length impact the clinical competency of staff nurses, particularly in terms of patient care, communication skills, management, and knowledge. Providing education and training in leadership and management to current and prospective head nurses may be expected to enhance clinical competency in staff nurses and create a more nurturing work environment. Moreover, targeted training may help current head nurses gain insight into their leadership styles and acquire skills to promote transformational leadership. In addition, leadership development may help equip prospective head nurses with critical competencies before assuming leadership responsibilities. © Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.","",,"",,,"",""

This paper built a hypothetical model for indigenous theoretical resources. In The Analects, Confucius offered propositions on the links between leaders' Junzi personality (i.e., Confucian ideal personality traits) and leadership effectiveness, as well as the mediating roles of leadership styles. To test our hypotheses, we conducted two studies involving 513 supervisor–subordinate dyads in China. Study 1 indicated that Junzi personality had a significantly positive effect on leadership effectiveness and that such significance remained even after controlling for the Big Five personality traits. It also examined the incremental value and relative importance. Study 2 showed that ethical and transformational leadership mediated the effect of Junzi personality on leadership effectiveness measured two months later. In both datasets, leaders with higher Junzi personality scores assigned higher self-ratings on performance, and their subordinates perceived higher leadership effectiveness, felt higher job satisfaction, and displayed lower turnover intentions. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","",,"",,,"",""

Leadership plays an important role, with transformational leadership driving innovation and transactional leadership supporting efficiency. The dominant leadership framework is the Full-Range Leadership Theory (FRLT), which identifies three leadership behaviors: transforma-tional, transactional, and passive avoidant. Organizational structures, following Mintzberg, Pugh and Galbraith, including span of control (SoC), unit grouping, and lateral linkages, significantly influence leadership dynamics. This study examines the impact of structural changes on perceived leadership styles in a Dutch radiotherapy center (RTc) following the implementation of proton therapy, a radical innovation. Patients and Methods: A mixed-method approach combined leadership surveys, with data collected at three time points, before and after structural changes in 2022. The multifactor leadership questionnaire (MLQ) was distributed among the employees in November 2021, March 2022, and March 2023. Three interventions were introduced: (1) appointing dedicated team leaders (TLs) to improve information flow and reduce management SoC; (2) integrating a Patient Care (PC) manager into the advisory board to facilitate direct communication within the governance structure, including other hierarchical layers; and (3) adding a proton therapy manager as a liaison to improve coordination. Leadership perceptions were measured using the Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire (MLQ) at three time points (T1, T2, T3). The Independent-Samples Mann–Whitney U-Test (p<0.05), was used to compare T1, T2, and T3, managers’ self-ratings with employee ratings, and scores between photon and proton treatment employees. Results: Transformational leadership significantly increased across all groups, with PC scores rising from 2.3 at T1/T2 to 2.5 at T3, and MT-PC scores from 1.8 at T1 to 2.4 at T3. Passive avoidant leadership significantly decreased (eg, MT-PC: 1.6 at T1 to 1.0 at T3). Transactional leadership showed less pronounced and non-significant changes. Photon therapy staff experienced earlier improvements in leadership perceptions, while proton therapy staff showed delayed but stronger shifts by T3. Conclusion: In this study, structural changes positively influenced leadership perceptions, supporting ambidexterity. Significant increases in transformational leadership and decreases in passive avoidant leadership align leadership styles with the dual demands of innovation and operational efficiency, demonstrating the importance of organizational design in healthcare leadership. Our findings show that healthcare management could use organizational structure changes to promote transformational leadership. © 2025 Swart et al.

A cross-sectional study design was employed. The Transformational Leadership Scale was used to measure the transformational leadership qualities of nurse managers. The Utrecht Work Engagement Scale (UWES-9) was used to measure nurses’ work engagement. The data were analyzed using statistical tests, the Pearson correlation coefficient, and linear regression analysis. Among the work engagement subscales, nurses scored highest on dedication to work (mean 4.14, SD 1.22) and lowest on vigor (mean 3.68, SD 1.9). For transformational leadership subscales, giving feedback and rewards received the lowest scores (mean of 2.64, SD 1.02), while management of the nursing process scored the highest (mean 3.25, SD 0.92). The correlation between transformational leadership and work engagement was statistically significant (r = 0.367, p < 0.001). In conclusion, transformational leadership by nurse managers may increase nurses’ work engagement. Nurse managers can develop and incorporate transformational leadership traits through training programs.

The goal of the present study is to test the impact of corporate psychopathy in leaders on their employee's attitudes and its impact above and beyond the influence of leadership styles associated with the Full-Range Leadership Model (Transformational, Transactional and Laissez-Faire leadership). A total of 74 supervisors and 423 subordinates participated in this study. Employees completed self-report measures of job satisfaction, turnover intentions, work motivation and job neglect. They also rated their immediate supervisor on the Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire and the B-Scan 360 (a corporate psychopathy measure). Hierarchical linear regressions indicated that the B-Scan 360 total score was the best predictor of employee's job satisfaction, turnover intentions, work motivation and job neglect (beyond the influence of the Full Range leadership Model). These results indicate that, for our sample, the B-Scan 360 is a stronger predictor of employee attitudes than the three leadership styles comprising the Full-Range Leadership Model. These results represent a stepping stone for future research trying to unravel the factors associated with dark leadership and its impact on employee attitudes. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","",,"",,,"",""
rayyan-304195479,Critical thinking of nurse managers related to staff RNs' perceptions of the practice environment,2010.0,1,1,,,,,,"Zori, S. and Nosek, L.J. and Musil, C.M.",,,,,"Background Information and Significance: Critical thinking (CT) skills and the inclination to engage in critical thinking are essential for nurse managers to function as transformational leaders capable of influencing staff to align with organizational goals. In an extensive literature review, numerous studies were found examining the concept of CT in students and no studies were found exploring CT in nurse managers. Identifying the attributes, such as CT, that lead to success in the nurse manager role is useful when preparing nurse managers to lead effectively in the current healthcare climate. Research Question: Is there a difference between nurse managers' CT dispositions and their respective staff nurses' perceptions of the practice environment?. Design: A convenience sample of 12 nurse managers and a random sample of 132 of their respective staff registered nurses (RNs) participated in this descriptive study. CT in nurse managers was measured by the California Critical Thinking Disposition Inventory (CCTDI). Staff RNs' perceptions of the practice environment were measured by the Practice Environment Scale (PES). The research question was answered using a t test. Findings: Significant (p < .001) differences were found between specific nurse managers' CCTDI scores for open-mindedness, analyticity, and critical thinking confidence, and significant differences (p < .01) were found for systematicity when compared with their respective staff RNs' mean subscale and overall PES scores. Conclusions: Results of the study support the positive relationship between strength in critical thinking dispositions of nurse managers and their respective staff RNs' perceptions of the practice environment. Nurse managers with stronger CT dispositions may be better able to create positive practice environments that are conducive to job satisfaction and thus the retention of staff RNs. Inclusion of strategies to support the development and use of CT in nurse managers is recommended. CT and other leadership attributes and skills including emotional and social intelligence and management of change through an appreciative inquiry process may provide opportunities to improve leadership effectiveness in nurse managers. Clinical Relevance: Enhancing critical thinking skills and dispositions of nurse managers may help to create positive work environments for staff RNs. Staff RNs who work in an environment perceived to be positive may be in a better position to deliver high quality, safe patient care. © 2010 Sigma Theta Tau International.","",,"",,,"",""

Yet the relationship between emotional intelligence and transformational leadership, a leadership style that is highly correlated with efficiency and satisfaction of the leaders' followers, has scarcely been analyzed. We hypothesize that individuals who score high in emotional intelligence emerge as leaders more easily than low-emotional-intelligence individuals due to the fact that they are more transformational in their leadership style. We further suggest that this is especially the case in highly cohesive groups. In this study, we test these ideas and find empirical support for our hypotheses. © 2008 University of Phoenix.","",,"",,,"",""

There are a few valid and reliable scales to evaluate job satisfaction for nurses in Turkey. Objectives: This methodological study was performed to determine whether the Turkish version of the ""McCloskey and Mueller Job Satisfaction Scale/MMSS"" is a valid and reliable tool for nurses in Turkey. Methods: This study was conducted with 324 nurses in three hospitals in Istanbul between June and August 2017. The study data collected using the ""Descriptive Characteristics Form"", and ""McCloskey and Mueller Job Satisfaction Scale"" consisting of 31 items. Results: The scale content validity index was 0.93. The Cronbach's alpha reliability coefficient was 0.81 for the overall scale and ranged from 0.45 to 0.70 for the sub-dimensions. The stability of the scale over time was tested with 32 nurses twice at a 15-day interval. There was no significant difference between the two measurements. The item-total score reliability coefficient of the scale ranged between 0.28 and 0.49. In the confirmatory factor analysis, the path coefficients of the items with their dimension (eight sub-dimensions) ranged between 0.36 and 0.64. The goodness of fit of the model determined in the confirmatory factor analysis was at an acceptable level (Chi square / Degree of freedom: 1.4, p < .05). Conclusion: The results of this study indicated that MMSS meets the content and construct validity criteria. Although reliability tests of the MMSS, which are item analysis and stability, are acceptable range there is a need for further research to test the reliability of Cronbach alpha on the subdimensions of the MMSS. © 2020, Dokuz Eylul University.

Methods: The study used cross-sectional data from 1632 employees of the overall workforce of a middle-sized German company (51.6% men; mean age, 41.35 years; standard deviation, 9.4 years). TL was assessed with the German version of the Transformational Leadership Inventory and depressive symptoms with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). The structural validity of the core TL scale was assessed with confirmatory factor analysis. Associations with depressive symptoms were estimated with structural equation modelling and adjusted logistic regression. Results: Confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modelling showed better model fit for the core TL than for the full TL score. Logistic regression revealed 3.61-fold (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.20 to 5.93: women) to 4.46-fold (95% CI, 2.86 to 6.95: men) increased odds of reporting depressive symptoms (HADS score >8) for those in the lowest tertile of reported core TL. Conclusions: The shortened core TL seems to be a valid instrument for research and training purposes in the context of TL and depressive symptoms in employees.

However, research on the measurement of leadership development in a virtual work environment for leaders in e-commerce businesses in Thailand is limited. Thus, the main purposes of this study were to examine the dimensions and to develop the scale of virtual transformational leadership for leaders in e-commerce businesses and test its psychometric properties. A multi-methods design was implemented to examine the dimensions and develop the virtual transformational leadership scale for leaders in e-commerce businesses. Firstly, the integration of virtual leadership and transformational leadership behaviors and interviewed with five e-commerce experts were conducted to synthesize the virtual transformational leadership dimensions for leaders in e-commerce businesses. The final 33-item scale of virtual transformational leadership for leaders in e-commerce businesses was generated and distributed as a second result. Data was collected using an online questionnaire, and the instruments used were Likert-type scales. The participants were 600 leaders in e-commerce businesses in Bangkok.

This research was undertaken as part of a Hybrid International Emergency Medicine Fellowship programme (Subedi et al., 2020) across UK and Nepal, incorporating a two-year rotation through the UK National Health Service, via the Medical Training Initiative (MTI) (AoMRC, 2017). The WHO TCC can improve outcomes for trauma patients (Lashoher et al., 2016); however, significant barriers affect its implementation worldwide (Nolan et al., 2014; Wild et al., 2020). This article reports on the implementation, barriers and recommendations of WHO TCC implementation in the context of Nepal and argues for Transformational Leadership (TL) to support its implementation. Design/methodology/approach: Explanatory mixed methods research (Creswell, 2014), comprising quasi-experimental research and a qualitative online survey, were selected methods for this research. A training module was designed and implemented for 10 doctors and 15 nurses from a total of 76 (33%) of clinicians to aid in the introduction of the WHO TCC in an emergency department in a hospital in Nepal. The quasi-experimental research involved a pre- and post-training survey aimed to assess participant’s knowledge of the WHO TCC before and after training and before the implementation of the WHO TCC in the emergency department. Post-training, 219 patients were reviewed after four weeks to identify if process measures had improved the quality of care to trauma patients. Subsequently six months later, a qualitative online survey was sent to all clinical staff in the department to identify barriers to implementation, with a response rate of 26 (n = 26) (34%) (20 doctors and 6 nurses). Descriptive statistics were used to evaluate quantitative data and the qualitative data were analysed using the five stepped approach of thematic analysis (Braun and Clarke, 2006). Findings: The evaluation of the implementation of the WHO TCC showed an improvement in care for trauma patients in an emergency setting in a tertiary hospital in Nepal. There were improvements in the documentation in trauma management, showing the training had a direct impact on the quality of care of trauma patients. Notably, there was an improvement in cervical spine examination from 56.1% before training to 78.1%; chest examination 125 (57.07%) before training and 170 (77.62%) post-training; abdominal examination 121 (55.25%) before training and 169 (77.16%) post-training; gross motor examination 13 (5.93%) before training and 131 (59.82%) post-training; sensory examination 4 (1.82%) before training and 115 (52.51%) post-training; distal pulse examination 6 (2.73%) before training and 122 (55.7%) post-training. However, while the quality of documentation for trauma patients improved from the baseline of 56%, it only reached 78% when the percentage improvement target agreed for this research project was 90%. The 10 (n = 10) doctors and 15 (n = 15) nurses in the Emergency Department (ED) all improved their baseline knowledge from 72.2% to 87% (p = 0.00006), by 14.8% and 67% to 85%) (p = 0.006), respectively. Nurses started with lower scores (mean 67) in the baseline when compared to doctors, but they made significant gains in their learning post-training. The qualitative data reported barriers, such as the busyness of the department, with residents and medical officers, suggesting a shortened version of the checklist to support greater protocol compliance. Embedding this research within TL provided a steer for successful innovation and change, identifying action for sustaining change over time. Research limitations/implications: The study is a single-centre study that involved trauma patients in an emergency department in one hospital in Nepal. There is a lack of internationally recognised trauma training in Nepal and very few specialist trauma centres; hence, it was challenging to teach trauma to clinicians in a single 1-h session. High levels of transformation of health services are required in Nepal, but the sample for this research was small to test out and pilot the protocol to gain wider stakeholder buy in. The rapid turnover of doctors and nurses in the emergency department, creates an additional challenge but encouraging a multi-disciplinary approach through TL creates a greater chance of sustainability of the WHO TCC. Practical implications: International protocols are required in Nepal to support the transformation of health care. This explanatory mixed methods research, which is part of an International Fellowship programme, provides evidence of direct improvements in the quality of patient care and demonstrates how TL can drive improvement in a low- to medium-income country. Social implications: The Nepal/UK Hybrid International Emergency Medicine Fellowships have an opportunity to implement changes to the health system in Nepal through research, by bringing international level standards and protocols to the hospital to improve the quality of care provided to patients. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this research paper is one of the first studies of its kind to demonstrate direct patient level improvements as an outcome of the two-year MTI scheme. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.","",,"",,,"",""

METHOD The original questionnaire was in English and the target version was in Greek. The process of translation into Greek was applied and then the translation of the Greek version into English, and finally the translation and cross-cultural adaptation process was checked. To test the reliability of the questionnaire, a test-retest study was conducted. Confirmatory factor analysis was performed to check validity. RESULTS The kappa indices in initial measurement and re-measurement for the seven questions of “Global Transformational Leadership scale” were found to have statistically significant relationships, indicating high reliability of the questionnaire. Furthermore, the high reliability of the questionnaire is also indicated by the fact that the intraclass correlation coefficient for the total score was extremely high and, more specifically, equal to 0.95 (95% confidence interval: 0.89 to 0.98, p<0.001). According to the results of the confirmatory factor analysis, the Greek version of the “Global Transformational Leadership scale” showed excellent fit, as all indicators had acceptable values. Moreover, the weighted regression weights had high values as they ranged from 0.74 to 0.89. Thus, it can be concluded that “Global Transformational Leadership scale” has high construct validity and is unidimensional.

Survey data were obtained from elementary school staff and students, and school-aggregated student achievement test scores were obtained from school archives. Results showed that staff reports of principal behaviors could be described in terms of the three components of transformational leadership: inspiration or charisma, individualized consideration, and intellectual stimulation. Principal transformational leadership was not associated directly with either school staff turnover or school-aggregated student achievement progress. Rather, principal transformational leadership showed an indirect effect, through staff job satisfaction, on school staff turnover (negative) and on school-aggregated student achievement progress (positive). Finally, higher levels of school staff job satisfaction were associated with smaller achievement gaps between minority and non-minority students.

This article builds on recent research on the importance of the managerial coaching by empirically investigating the effects of a cognitive-behavioral coaching programme over mid-level managers. Due to the similarities between managerial coaching behaviors and transformational leadership behaviors, we have adopted the transformational leadership model as theoretical framework for evaluating management behaviors. The study used a pre-posttest approach to test the effects of the coaching program especially designed for 23 mid-level managers having as responsibility the supervision of production teams in a multinational organization. The major aims of the program consisted of: developing managerial coaching skills, assertive communication skills, motivation of subordinates. Overall, the analysis of results elicited an increase of scores in the leadership behavior dimensions measured by multifactor leadership questionnaire that are part of the managerial coaching skills. Besides, the effectiveness perceived as an indicator of performance was significantly higher upon completion of the coaching program. Findings suggest that coaching, as a professional development method, has great potential to contribute to the managerial behaviors that facilitate development at subordinate level, as they are captured by some transformational and transactional scales. Such knowledge can be informative for practitioners as well in developing effective managers and leaders and understanding and managing employee attitudes and behaviors in organizations. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","",,"",,,"",""
rayyan-304195490,Views and understanding of clinicians on the leadership role and attitude to coaching as a development tool for clinical leadership,2011.0,1,1,,,,,,"Budhoo, M.R. and Spurgeon, P.",,,,,"Background: Coaching is a recognised method of leadership development which is utilised for leaders in many organisations but is less so with clinical leaders in healthcare. Coaching has demonstrated potential in leadership development with high returns on investment. This could be transferred to healthcare and may be of benefit in improving quality of care cost-effectively. This would require long-term changes to develop a coaching culture in healthcare. Aim: The aim of this study is to understand the views of clinicians on leadership roles and the use of coaching as a development tool. Method: The study was questionnaire-based with ethical approval from the organisation where the study was done. The study had both qualitative and quantitative elements. Analysis of quantitative measures was done by Chi square test. P = 0.05 regarded as significant. The views on key aspects of leadership were coded against the medical leadership competency framework. Results: Forty questionnaires were sent out and 22 returned (55% response rate). Most of the respondents were in post for at least 10 years and viewed their clinical role as leadership. Significantly more respondents were in post for longer than 10 years and those in post under 10 years were significantly more likely to consider other training tools apart from coaching. The majority rated their leadership at six or higher on a scale of 1-10. Fifty-nine percent had training in leadership and this is reflected in low scores on the need for further training, although most would accept training and that it has a role in leadership development. Regarding leadership roles, respondents' views were coded to the medical leadership competency framework with setting direction having the highest match (30%). The views also had aspects of charismatic and transformational leadership styles. Coaching was felt to be a useful tool in developing leadership although there were some concerns in ensuring confidentiality and match between coach and coached. Most would consider use of a coach but expressed as a whole the view that the coach should be experienced, from outside the organisation and have a healthcare background. Conclusions and recommendations: The study indicates that training in leadership for development is supported by clinicians in leadership roles and that there is support for coaching as a developmental tool with a preference for external coaches with a healthcare background. This appears to be primarily due to seniority of clinicians and concerns around confidentiality and independence. Further work should be explored to promote a coaching culture amongst clinicians. © 2012 Radcliffe Publishing.","",,"",,,"",""

Diverse theories suggest different styles of leadership, with strong relationships between the different styles and their outcomes. The transformational style emphasizes motivating employees and encouraging them to find new ways of dealing with issues. The transactional (TL) style promotes ideas of rewards and punishments. The Laissez-faire style is characterized by relaxation and the tendency to leave things to happen with minimal interference. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a descriptive cross-sectional study design conducted in Primary Healthcare Centers in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. The leadership styles were assessed using a Multi-Factor Leadership Questionnaire, which identifies the different styles of leadership. SPSS v 26.0 was used for data analysis. t-test employed to compare leadership style between raters and managers. Logistics regression model used to determine the influence of leadership styles of managers. Pearson correlation coefficient determined the linear relationship between leadership styles and its domains. RESULTS: A total of 130 respondents (65 managers vs. 65 raters) took part. 'Raters' refer to any persons other than the manager, such as a secretary, nurse, doctor. The 'manager' is when the person rates himself. The global transformation mean score was 3.55, for TL it was 3.42 and for passive avoidant, the mean score was 0.93. The passive avoidant (t = 2.005; P = 0.047) and management by exception (passive) (MBEP) mean scores of raters were statistically significantly higher than managers. In the binary regression model, MBEP was the independent significant predictor of manager. CONCLUSION: The perceived leadership style of Primary Healthcare Center managers was transformational but with TL. Transformational leadership was positively correlated with TL leadership but negatively correlated with passive avoidant (The Laissez-faire style). The outcome of this study demonstrated that intellectual stimulation, idealized attributes, and inspirational motivation are perhaps better than contingent reward, active management. © 2022 Journal of Family and Community Medicine | Published by Wolters Kluwer-Medknow.","",,"",,,"",""

We examined if the relation between intelligence (IQ) and perceived leadership might be more accurately described by a curvilinear single-peaked function. Following Simonton's (1985) theory, we tested a specific model, indicating that the optimal IQ for perceived leadership will appear at about 1.2 standard deviations above the mean IQ of the group membership. The sample consisted of midlevel leaders from multinational private-sector companies. We used the leaders' scores on the Wonderlic Personnel Test (WPT)-a measure of IQ-to predict how they would be perceived on prototypically effective leadership (i.e., transformational and instrumental leadership). Accounting for the effects of leader personality, gender, age, as well as company, country, and time fixed effects, analyses indicated that perceptions of leadership followed a curvilinear inverted-U function of intelligence. The peak of this function was at an IQ score of about 120, which did not depart significantly from the value predicted by the theory. As the first direct empirical test of a precise curvilinear model of the intelligence-leadership relation, the results have important implications for future research on how leaders are perceived in the workplace. © 2017 American Psychological Association.","",,"",,,"",""

Results: According to the evaluations of the unit charge nurses and staff nurses; it was found that the unit charge nurses' averages scores for prodding others into action, encouraging others and questioning the process sub-dimension and total leadership practice were significantly higher than those of the staff nurses. Patient Safety Culture perceptions of unit charge nurses are higher than service nurses. According to the findings obtained from the study, there is a positive relationship between nurses' transformational leadership practices and patient safety culture. Conclusion: In the study, it has been shown that there is a positive relationship between nurses' transformational leadership practices and patient safety culture. In order to create a positive patient safety culture in the units of charge nurses, it is necessary to develop the unit charge nurses' transformational leadership practices. © 2021, Dokuz Eylul University.

Method: The research was conducted as a cross-sectional study involving 315 nurses. Data were collected using the Individual Innovativeness Scale, Global Transformational Leadership Scale, and information form on socio-demographic and professional characteristics of nurses. Analyses included t-tests, One-way ANOVA, correlation, and regression. Results: The mean individual innovativeness score was 59.41 (SD=9.41), indicating a moderate level. Classification of innovativeness levels showed that 2.9% were ""innovators,"" 13.7% were ""early adopters,"" 42.5% were ""late majority,"" and 34% were ""laggards."" A positive and moderate relationship was found between individual innovativeness and transformational leadership (r=0.66; p<0.05). Professional and demographic variables explained 47% of the total variance in individual innovativeness (R²=0.47; p<0.01), increasing to 62% when transformational leadership was included (R²=0.62; ΔR²=0.15; p<0.01). Age, years of experience, and education were significant predictors of individual innovativeness (p<0.01). Conclusion: The findings reveal a need to improve nurses’ innovativeness and highlight the critical role of transformational leadership in fostering innovative behavior. Promoting transformational leadership skills and implementing innovative professional development programs are recommended in healthcare settings. © 2025 The Authors.","",,"",,,"",""

Instructional leadership refers to the development of learning improvement plans, while transformational leadership is associated with improving motivation as well as collaborative work. On the other hand, distributed leadership aims to empower people on the task of assuming leadership roles considering school context. This study uses instructional leadership as a cornerstone to define a basic organizational structure for the further development of more sophisticated leadership approaches.

Participants reported that most of principals' leadership practices did not focus on student learning, but rather on school administration and management. Many respondents felt that it was not their job to lead in several instruction-related areas.

After teachers and teaching, school leadership is the most important determinant of learner achievement in school. Despite this, there is still uncertainty regarding what successful school leadership is and what successful school leaders do in non-Western contexts. In this mixed methods study I explored successful high school leadership in South Africa. Specifically, a questionnaire was administered to 38 principals from academically high-achieving schools from a range of socioeconomic contexts throughout the Western Cape, and 14 principals were interviewed. An integrated analysis reveals the paradox of uniqueness and universality of successful school leadership in South Africa, outlining that while there is no single best approach, various similarities exist between successful school leaders and established international literature. I found that successful principals adapt to their context, amalgamate transformational, instructional and distributed leadership styles, set direction, develop people, constantly realign the school with teaching and learning, and, importantly, strive to make a difference in the lives of others. It is about leading with Ubuntu. By highlighting these characteristics and practices, I offer theoretical, practical and personal advice to current and aspiring school leaders, academics and policy makers.","",,"",,,"",""

The purpose of this paper is to test a model of integrated transformational leadership including three important school mediators. Design/methodology/approach-In total, 5,392 students provided data on student engagement, and 569 teachers provided survey data on principal leadership and the collective teacher efficacy (CTE) and extra effort of their colleagues. Data were analyzed at the school level (n = 51) using mediation analysis with the PROCESS macro to calculate the direct and indirect effects of all of the variables in the serial multiple mediator model. Findings-The model explained a significant amount of variance in both reading (38 percent) and mathematics (35 percent). CTE and student engagement mediated all of the leadership effects, demonstrating the importance of teacher and student relations in school improvement. The combined effect sizes are significantly greater than the effects of earlier TL models. Originality/value-This study contributes to ""leadership for learning"" research by demonstrating that refining transformational leadership behaviors to include instructional management can enhance a leader's impact on achievement. As one of the few studies to examine student engagement as a mediator along with teacher mediators, the current study highlights the importance of teacher-student relations in school improvement. While collective efficacy mediated all of the effects of leadership on achievement, student emotional engagement also contributed to mathematics achievement. The study's findings advance research into mutual influence processes, indicating that reciprocity may extend throughout the leader-teacher-student loop.","",,"",,,"",""

Considerable debate has emerged over the most suitable model for academic leadership: not surprisingly, one of the conceptual models dominating the literature is transformational leadership. This study proposes to investigate academic leadership behavior from the perspective of transformational leadership. First, this paper reviews transformational leadership as a concept in detail with its four components: Charismatic Leadership, or Idealized Influence, Inspirational Motivation, Intellectual Stimulation, and Individualized Consideration. Second, the methodological details and the results of the study are explicitly discussed. The Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire (MLQ) is used to measure different components of transformational leadership as a research instrument. The total field under survey consists of 100 participants including research assistants, instructors, associate professors and full professors of different state universities in Turkey. The SPSS 15.0 (Statistical Package for Social Sciences) is applied to analyze the data gathered by the research instrument. In order to determine whether or not there has been any difference among the academics' perceptions of transformational leadership, with its four dimensions, according to gender, age, tenure, and education variables, non-parametric tests are used. As for the results of the study, the level of 5-point Likert scale measuring the administrators' behavior from the perspective of transformational leadership including all four dimensions is ""once a while"". Of the independent variables, only the education variable is specified as a significant factor affecting the academics' perceptions of transformational leadership. In other words, the level of transformational leadership attitude for the ones having bachelor's degree is indicated to be higher than the others, while the levels are indicated as similar for the ones having B.Ed. and M.A. degrees. In the dimensions of Idealized Influence and Inspirational Motivation, the level of PhD graduates' perceptions of transformational leadership is higher than that of M.A. graduates.

The study participants were 24 principals from elementary schools in Israel, and data collection involved conducting semi-structured interviews. The collected data underwent three stages of analysis: sorting, coding, and categorizing. The findings revealed three key areas in which the principal's instructional leadership influences the school's middle leadership: the expectations of middle leaders, the selection and appointment of middle leaders, and the hierarchical structure of middle leaders within the school. These findings highlight the comprehensive impact of instructional leadership on various organizational aspects of middle leadership in schools.","",,"",,,"",""

With this end in mind, we have employed a SEM to analyze the correlations between principals' leadership styles, teacher classroom leadership, and teacher motivation. The study's sample group consisted of 325 teachers employed in primary education institutions. The Leadership Style Scale, Teacher Classroom Leadership Scale, and Teacher Professional Motivation Scale were used to collect data. We found that although teachers' classroom leadership levels were higher than principals' leadership levels, principals' leadership had a higher direct impact on teacher motivation than did teacher classroom leadership and that quality interaction both in school and in the classroom is the single most influential component on teacher classroom leadership and motivation. Our findings suggest that the primary determinant of teacher classroom leadership and motivation lies in the quality of interactions within both the school and classroom environments. These results underscore the significance of principals' leadership roles in current scholarly discussions on shared leadership in educational settings and on the conceptualization of teacher leadership. Consequently, sharing leadership does not diminish its impact but rather amplifies it. Nevertheless, while promoting shared leadership and empowering teachers are indeed virtuous endeavors in and of themselves, principal leadership is one of the most influential factors teacher motivation.","",,"",,,"",""

Three-level structural equation modeling indicates that family and school contexts influenced the enactment of principal leadership. Specifically, principals were able to exercise leadership (envisioning, conducting instructional management, promoting professional development, and advocating empowerment) in schools with more science resources. In contrast, principals seemingly addressed teacher capacity issues by envisioning and promoting the professional development and empowerment of teachers in schools with low socioeconomic status. The instructional management of principals was positively related to the enjoyment and interest of students in science, and those with high levels of such learning attitudes obtained high levels of science achievement.

The authors examined the following research questions: does the school context influence the principal's leadership? When the influences of the school context are controlled for, does the principal's leadership influence the process variables related to teachers and educational climate? Design/methodology/approach - The research questions are analysed in a multilevel context by developing two models regarding the hypothesized relationships between the study variables. With the use of multilevel structural equation modelling techniques the models were empirically tested on data from Italian teachers and students from a sample of schools in Italy. The database include 1,566 teachers from 47 schools of different types and levels from the Autonomous Province of Trento. Findings - In those schools which have the highest leadership scores, the authors also find a greater degree of job satisfaction among the teachers, higher levels of self-efficacy of teachers, and a better educational climate, which is more respectful of the basic rules of coexistence existing within the school. An interesting additional element is that the positive relationship between the exercise of leadership and the process variables related to academic success is still present, even if the effects of the school context are controlled for. Research limitations/implications - It should be observed that the results of this study, particularly due to the non-representative nature of the sample considered, should be considered as preliminary evidence that will require further confirmation, and which cannot be immediately generalized. The results obtained can be influenced by the specific territorial area in which this search has been conducted. The Autonomous Province of Trento, from the rest of Italy, is characterized by a highly centralized education system, with a relative homogeneity of the conditions of the context in which schools have achieved so widespread high levels of student learning. Originality/value - When studying leadership it is important to consider the school context, particularly the role of the initial level of learning of the students, as this study shows that in schools where the prior knowledge of students is greater, teachers are generally more satisfied with their job and they report a better educational environment. If the influence of the context were not taken into account, this could easily be mistaken for that of the actions of the principal.","",,"",,,"",""

It acknowledges that leadership responsibilities are shared across stakeholders, inviting wider sources of leadership. If leadership for learning conceptualizes leadership as an organization-wide practice beyond that of an individual (e.g. the school principal), its measurement must accordingly invite perceptions and experiences of diverse stakeholders at multiple levels. Focusing solely on principals' or teachers' leadership perceptions is problematic since it fails to capture the unique lived realities teachers or principals experience concerning leadership enactment. It also limits the capacity to examine whether and how these multiple perspectives exert same or divergent impacts on staff development, school culture, and student learning. Thus, this study employed leadership for learning as its theoretical framework and rigorous multilevel factor analysis techniques to examine the extent to which individual teachers, teachers collectively, and principals show distinct perceptions of leadership practices.

The Organizational Leadership Model hypothesizes four distinct conditions of school leadership, and the analysis investigates the relationship between teacher, principal, and school outcomes; school descriptors; and a school's category in the Organizational Leadership Model. Theoretical Orientation: Ogawa and Bossert's conception of leadership as an organizational quality serves as the theoretical foundation of this study, along with contemporary theories of distributed leadership, influence as leadership, and measurement of leadership. Data Source: This study draws teacher, principal, and school restricted-use data from the 2003-2004 Schools and Staffing Survey. The sample consists of 7,950 schools, their principals, and a random sample of teachers from each school. The school is the primary unit of analysis. Analysis: This study is conducted in two phases. In Phase 1, the Organizational Leadership Model (OLM) is tested for its ability to discriminate between teacher, principal, and school outcomes through a series of one-way ANOVA models. In Phase 2, a series of brr weighted ordered logit models explores the predictive power of school descriptors in determining the OLM category of schools. Findings: The analysis finds evidence that the Organizational Leadership Model is a robust measure of leadership as an organizational quality that effectively captures differences in school leadership contexts at the level of principals' and teachers' perceptions of their influence that precede task-oriented behaviors. Additionally, the study highlights the troubling relationship between schools serving high-need populations and those typified by low levels of school leadership. Implications for Research and Practice: The article identifies several avenues for future research to extend inquiry on the potential of the Organizational Leadership Model to develop additional nuance in discriminating between relationships among school contexts, leadership conditions, and teacher, principal, and school outcomes.

While various styles, such as transformational, instructional, shared instructional, point to the similar measures of high organizational quality, the inconsistency in how these styles are defined and relate make it unclear how principals systematically improve schools. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach - This study used the 1999-2000 schools and staffing survey, n = 8,524 of US principals, since it includes a nationally representative sample of administrators who responded to a comprehensive set of leadership measures around a time of school restructuring reforms. Confirmatory factor analysis was used to identify different styles, and to measure the extent of their relationship. These factors were used to test a theory about why principals practice each of these styles to a different degree based on levels of shared instructional leadership. Findings - Based on the theoretical framework, principals should have a similar high influence over resources, safety and facilities regardless of degree of shared instructional leadership since these tasks address foundational school needs. However, principal and teacher influence over these resources differed across levels of shared instructional leadership more than principal-directed tasks of facilitating a mission, supervising instruction and building community.

Participants (N = 23) came from junior, middle and senior management levels. Findings suggest that their notions of leadership as well as any developmental needs/activities perceived useful, differ according to their leadership level. Although junior leaders were more concerned with procedural elements of leading, senior leaders focused on mentoring, social expectations and knowledge of academia. These findings have important implications for a wider theoretical conceptualisation of academic leadership, which are typically focused on individual senior leaders. Further, our findings inform leadership development programmes, as universities' dealings with academic leaders tend not to consider the differing requirements of junior, middle and senior academic leaders.","",,"",,,"",""

Given that multiple school functions are needed to serve society at different levels, the required roles in school leadership are inevitably multiple, diverse and demanding. In past decades, many studies have been conducted with a focus on some aspects of leadership functions and processes. Unfortunately, there is a lack of a typology of school leadership to map out comprehensive leadership profiles and understand their multiple characteristics for leading school development and effectiveness in a fast-changing environment. Based on the framework of multiple school effectiveness, this paper aims to propose a typology of multiple school leadership that can provide a new, comprehensive way to re-conceptualize the multiple nature and characteristics of school leadership in a complicated context. Depending on the rationalities, concerns, actions, outcomes and contexts of leadership in practice, the typology of multiple school leadership may include six models: technological leadership, economic leadership, social leadership, political leadership, cultural leadership, and learning leadership. Within this typology, new possibilities and approaches to school leadership can be drawn for research, practice and development towards the future.","",,"",,,"",""

Successful leadership is ensured by school leaders' compliance to a set of basic practices within particular school contexts. The impact of leadership styles on performance, the work environment and job satisfaction is emphasized, while the appropriate leadership style could make teachers more effective in terms of job productivity. The adoption of different leadership styles by school leaders shows positive results with regard to school effectiveness. The purpose of this paper is to describe school leadership styles and the influence the styles have on school performance. Design/methodology/approach A quantitative approach with a post-positive paradigm was followed. A systematic random sample of 72 secondary schools in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, was selected. The Cronbach's alpha coefficient, statistical significance (p-values) and effect size (d-values) were calculated, and a factor analysis was conducted. Findings The results show a difference between teachers and principals regarding the transformational leadership style. The principals in the high-performing schools were perceived as less passive-avoidant in practice than those in the low-performing schools. A principal manages and leads a school effectively by applying an appropriate leadership style. Research limitations/implications - For future research, it will be advisable tomake use of a mixed-method design. Although the Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire addressed numerous aspects of leadership and leadership styles, the ""voice"" of the respondents lacked. Furthermore, more leadership styles could be investigated in different contexts. Practical implications - A chosen principal leadership style is not necessarily the best style for this purpose. School principals and teachers interpret leadership styles differently. Communication is therefore important. Social implications The principal leadership style is not always necessarily the teachers' and learners' choice. It is important that schools keep up with a constantly changing world.

Using multiple regression analysis, transformational leadership accounted for a significant incremental effect above that of transactional leadership in bringing about enhanced school, teacher, program and instruction, and student outcomes. This supports a compelling argument that school leaders can promote change more successfully through employing methods associated with transformational leadership.","",,"",,,"",""

It directly or indirectly influences almost all factors that affect school transformation. It influences students' academic, social, emotional, cultural, and moral wellbeing as well as the performance, commitment, citizenship behavior, innovativeness, and instructional practices of the teachers. Effective leadership is always multidimensional and complex. Leaders in successfully transformed schools demonstrate multiple and distinct leadership behaviors in order to influence different aspects of school life. They encompass the ability to be task-oriented, change-oriented, relation-oriented, and ethical-oriented leaders. The purpose of this paper is twofold. First, it intends to portray how the four dimensions of leadership behavior collectively give a better and comprehensive elucidation for understanding school leadership. Second, it aims to justify how these four dimensions of leadership behavior can be integrated together to facilitate school transformation process. This paper analytically reviews research and writings on school leadership behavior and proposes a conceptual model applicable and appropriate to explain leadership in the context of school transformation. The proposed model extends the tri-dimensional leadership behavior theory by incorporating ethical-oriented leadership behavior in it. In addition, the conceptual model is supported through review of literature for its applicability in schools. From the review, it is found that the current literature on leadership behavior is quite baffling. Different behavior dimensions explained by different researchers are sometimes overlapping and contrasting to each other on the same leadership concepts, actions, or outcomes. Moreover, the current literature on leadership behavior in school context is mainly related to transformational, transactional, and instructional leadership behaviors. Despite that, some researchers have criticized and found theoretical and empirical weaknesses in those leadership behaviors due to the intervening effects of factors such as culture, personality, organization structure, and government policy. Conversely, at the general theoretical level, researchers have categorized many leadership behaviors into certain orientations such as task-oriented, relation-oriented, change-oriented behaviors, and ethical-oriented leadership behaviors. These behavior dimensions are not just a group of distinct behaviors, but they also give a better platform to compare and contrast studies by different researchers. The behavior constructs included in them are clear and distinct. These leadership orientations cover almost all behaviors proposed in instructional, transformational, ethical, moral, distributed, and transactional leadership models.","",,"",,,"",""

These meta-analyses collectively examined 512 primary studies published across four decades (1978-2019). Results showed that the overall mean effect size for school leadership was small in magnitude (r= .33). Effect sizes for leadership models were larger than those for leadership practices, thereby indicating the utility of examining models as compared to practices for understanding leadership influence. Relatedly, findings of significant positive effects for eight different school leadership practices underscore the need to examine comprehensively the scope of school leaders' work beyond that related to teaching-and-learning. Additionally, leaders require myriad competencies and skills including how to galvanize, motivate and equip teachers to achieve school goals. The substantially larger mean effect sizes for organizational and teacher as compared to student outcomes challenge the assertion by some that principals are less consequential than teachers in contributing to school effectiveness. Indeed, the larger effect sizes for principals as compared to other types of leaders reflect the key role they play in leading schools.","",,"",,,"",""

The analyses found that (a) teachers' perceptions of their evaluation have a significant explanatory power on their job satisfaction, and (b) when their perceptions of evaluation are controlled, teachers' self-efficacy can explain additional variance in teachers' job satisfaction. Specifically, teachers' self-efficacy for student engagement was significantly predictive. Implications for educational policymakers and practitioners in light of enhancing teacher job satisfaction and developing rigorous teacher evaluation are discussed.","",,"",,,"",""

It identifies paths through which leadership explains differences in achievement and instruction between schools and differences in instruction among teachers within the same school. Research Design: Multilevel structural equation modeling was used to examine the relationships among principal leadership, school organizational structures, classroom instruction, and student grades and test gains on ACT's Education Planning and Assessment System. Measures of principal leadership and school organizational structures were collected from teacher surveys administered to all high school teachers in Chicago Public Schools in the 2006-2007 school years. Findings: Within schools, variation in classroom instruction is associated with principal leadership through multiple pathways, the strongest of which is the quality of professional development and coherence of programs. Between schools, differences in instruction and student achievement are associated with principal leadership only via the learning climate. This suggests that in high schools, establishing a safe, college-focused climate may be the most important leadership function for promoting achievement schoolwide.","",,"",,,"",""

In this research, we examined the relationship between integrated leadership and teacher professional learning and teacher practices in Turkey, where educational policy makers have recently introduced several school reform initiatives. More specifically, we aimed to examine the moderating function of transformational leadership in the relationship between instructional leadership and teacher practices, with an emphasis on the mediating role of teacher professional learning. Research Design: We conducted this study with a cross-sectional design and moderated mediation model. Data collected from 616 teachers working in a mix of primary and secondary schools in Turkey were analyzed using structural equation modeling and bootstrapping tests. Findings: We found evidence that transformational leadership acted as a moderator of the indirect effect of principal instructional leadership on teachers' instructional practices through teacher professional learning. Implications: This study adds to the accumulated body of knowledge on the effects of school leadership by concluding that the effect of instructional leadership on teacher learning and practice is contingent upon the extent to which principals enact transformational leadership. School principals who adopt a more comprehensive leadership approach that combines instructional leadership and transformational leadership practices can maximize their effects on student achievement through teacher learning, and better address the ever-growing demands of educational reforms.","",,"",,,"",""

Thus far, little effort has been made to foster a transdisciplinary curricula beyond traditional organizational theories related to school culture and climate; learning sciences; and supervision. School leadership programs are currently inadequately preparing elementary leaders in rigorous pedagogies involving science education. Although the role of principals is often not discussed concerning science implementation in elementary education, principals play a critical role in science decision-making. In this study, the authors present a case study of one elementary principal who also served as an othermother. Othermothers have been described as those who share mothering responsibilities in Black communities. Through interview transcripts, field notes, and social network data, the authors examine how this othermother cared for her students and community by advocating for science instruction. By strategically navigating the socio-political and policy climate and drawing on her authentic relationships, this othermother was critical in implementing a science agenda for elementary science. Three themes that emerged from the data analysis are, (1) othermothers view science as a potential means to transform lives and fulfill the needs of the local community, (2) science policies (i.e., federal, state, and local) can limit the potential of the vision of science an othermother has for the community, (3) othermothers draw on their community to guide equitable science instruction. Overall, othermothers have visions for what science can do. However, they cannot counter the status quo individually. Collective action among educators in various roles is one means of moving an equity agenda concerning science education forward.","",,"",,,"",""

The purpose of this paper is to examine relationships between principal leadership, dimensions of school capacity, and teacher professional learning in 32 Hong Kong primary schools. Design/methodology/approach - The study employed a cross-sectional research design and quantitative methods to analyze teacher perceptions of principal leadership and key school conditions. The research employed hierarchical linear regression analysis to explore survey data collected from a sample of 970 teachers. The surveys covered a range of principal leadership and school capacity dimensions, as well as a measure of teacher professional learning. Findings - Results indicated that multiple dimensions of principal leadership made significant contributions to both school capacity and teacher professional learning. The presence of cooperation, trust, communication, support for students, and alignment, coherence, and structure in schools also affected teacher professional learning. Research limitations/implications - These findings contribute to the global discourse on leadership for learning. The study addresses the need established by multiple scholars (e.g. Leithwood, Hallinger, Heck, Robinson, Witziers) for research that further illuminates ""paths"" and ""intermediate targets"" through which leadership impacts teaching and learning. The findings elaborate on the means by which leadership can enhance school capacities that directly impact teacher classroom practice and student learning. Consistent with other scholarly research (e.g. Bryk and Schneider, Louis and colleagues, Sahphier and King) the findings also point toward the importance of establishing selected workplace conditions (e.g. trust, cooperation, communication) as a foundation for fostering teacher professional learning. Practical implications - The study reinforces the finding from other studies that it is productive for principals to foster an environment aimed at enhancing teacher professionalism. The study also highlights the potentially dysfunctional consequences that can arise from competing system-level initiatives aimed at increasing monitoring and teacher accountability and fostering teacher professionalism.

The objectives of this article are to (a) better understand how teachers' collective decision making and principal's leadership are related to the schools' culture homogeneity and (b) test the moderating role of the schools' culture homogeneity on the relationship between four cultural scales and the schools' mathematics achievement. Method: The sample of this study consisted of 2,595 students nested in 52 schools and 125 classes from the French-speaking community of Belgium. Students performed two mathematics achievement tests and answered a self-reported questionnaire on their backgrounds. All the teachers (n = 817) of the 52 schools answered a self-reported questionnaire dealing with the principal's leadership, school culture, and teacher collegiality. Hypotheses are tested using correlation, regression, and hierarchical regression analyses. Research Findings: First, it was found that culture homogeneity is positively associated with (a) the principal's transformational leadership (TL) and (b) the teachers' collective decision making relative to pedagogical aspects. Second, it was shown that the impact of TL on culture homogeneity is partially mediated by teachers' collective decision making.

The teacher perceptions showed that leadership frames preferred by school principals are, respectively, structural, political, human resource and symbolic frame. It was also found that the collective teacher efficacy perceptions of teachers were influenced by seniority of teachers and settlement location of schools. Controlling for the variables of seniority and settlement location of school, all leadership frames were found to be predictors of the collective teacher efficacy. Accordingly, while the strongest predictor was the symbolic frame, the weakest predictor was the structural frame.","",,"",,,"",""

Part of the problem is the unreliability of many measures of leadership quality. In addition, the field has been dominated until quite recently by abstract theories of leadership which are not closely aligned to the specific work of educational leaders. While recent research by economists has confirmed that school leadership makes a significant difference to student outcomes, their analyses beg the question of how these effects are produced. In this article we address this question by updating the first author's 2008 model of student-centred leadership which identified the average impact of five sets of leadership practices on student outcomes. We argue that future research programmes should develop theories and measures of educational leadership which are based on expert judgments of the quality of enactment of these five sets of practices, and test their impact on a wider range of student outcomes.","",,"",,,"",""

rayyan-304195950,Supporting principal supervisors: what really matters?,2019.0,1,1,,,,,,"Honig, MI and Rainey, LR",,,,,"Purpose Districts across the country are calling on their principal supervisors to shift from mainly focusing on operations and compliance to dedicating their time to help principals grow as instructional leaders. Learning theory elaborates that such support for principals demands that supervisors take a teaching-and-learning approach - which the authors define as consistently using particular strategies that are characteristic of high quality teachers and mentors across various apprenticeship settings - to their work with principals on their instructional leadership. Prior research on leadership supports these shifts but does not examine the conditions under which principal supervisors are able to persist and grow in taking a teaching-and-learning approach specifically. What are those conditions? The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach This paper addresses that question through a re-examination of data from two studies with socio-cultural learning theory as the conceptual framework. The authors primarily use observation data (approximately 760 hours), supplemented by 344 interviews and reviews of hundreds of documents. Findings Contrary to extant research the authors did not associate high quality outside coaching with the positive cases of principal supervision. Nor did hiring principal supervisors with requisite prior knowledge explain why some principal supervisors regressed and grew. Findings underscore the importance of supervisors of principal supervisors (SPSs) being principal supervisors' main mentors and principal supervisors not over-relying on others for assistance but actively leading their own learning, especially through work with colleagues and protecting their time themselves. Originality/value This analysis distinguishes conditions that support principal supervisors in taking a teaching-and-learning approach to their work with principals. The authors elaborate key roles for chief academic officers and others who supervise principal supervisors typically overlooked in policy and research on district leadership. Findings reinforce the importance of mentoring to learning and also district leaders serving as main mentors for each other, rather than relying on outside coaching.","",,"",,,"",""

However, few educational studies link educational leadership to SHRM. In particular, this study examines the relationship between principals' instructional and transformational leadership style and principals' strategic and HR orientation in configuring HR practices for new teachers. Data were gathered using a mixed methods approach, including interviews with 75 principals as well as an online survey of 1058 teachers in Flemish primary education.

The findings demonstrate that key elements within the supportive school context-particularly sense of belonging, cooperation, clear goals, and appreciative leadership-have a positive influence on teacher retention. Conversely, general support within initial guidance exhibits a comparatively weaker predictive value. The qualitative analysis reveals inconsistencies in the provision and quality of initial guidance support across schools, which adversely impacts teachers' professional integration and job satisfaction.

Currently, there is great interest in how quality leadership preparation is related to leadership practice and improved teacher outcomes. The purpose of the study was to understand the moderating influence of leadership preparation on leadership practices and teachers' job collaboration, leadership and satisfaction. The study features a non-experimental design that combined data from a US study of exemplary leadership preparation and a nationally representative sample of elementary school principals. The sample consists of 175 teachers whose principals were prepared in an exemplary leadership program and 589 teachers whose principals were traditionally prepared. Data were analyzed with structural equation techniques and results have shown that innovative leadership preparation exerts a statistically significant direct effect on principalship leadership practices and a significant indirect effect on teacher collaboration and satisfaction. The results provide important policy implications. Investments in leadership preparation influences leadership practices that yield more positive teacher work conditions, which are essential for improve student learning and as a result leadership preparation program design and improvement can play an important role in district reform and school improvement.","",,"",,,"",""

In this essay, we suggest that educators should find ways to help students develop and deepen leader character, a fundamental component of exemplary leadership. Frequently, business school students have preconceived ideas of leadership, often neglecting leader character. We argue that educators can and should teach students that leader character is pivotal to leadership excellence and that they should actively develop students' leader character. The foundational learning theories of Piaget and Kolb provide a useful framework to help achieve the development of leader character. We propose that leader character development arises from using accommodation learning strategies of crucible experiences, paired with assimilation learning methods of critical reflection, and further developed through equilibrium learning strategies where students can incorporate new information and work toward their personal character growth. While numerous teaching approaches can be used, we describe an experiential course, codesigned with members of the Canadian Forces, using these learning strategies to foster leader character development.","",,"",,,"",""

The authors examine whether the new model, Teacher Peer Excellence Group (TPEG), fosters the desired key features of productive communities of practice where teachers can jointly construct, transform, preserve, and continuously deepen the meaning of effective teaching. The authors also explore the extent to which existing school conditions - principal instructional leadership, trust, teacher efficacy, and teachers' sense of school-wide professional community - enable or moderate the desired outcomes. Design/methodology/approach - Data for this paper are drawn from a series of surveys administered to teachers from 24 pilot schools in six school districts over two school years. Descriptive and multilevel modeling analyses are conducted. Findings - The findings provide encouraging evidence that, given sufficient support and guidance, teachers report higher levels of engagement in deprivatized practice and instructional collaboration. These findings also hold after controlling for key enabling conditions and school characteristics. Social implications - The TPEG approach challenges school leaders to take on the responsibilities of helping teachers make their practice public, sharable, and better - three critical objectives in the shift to develop the profession of teaching. Originality/value - The indication of TPEG model's positive impact on strengthening the features of communities of practice in selected public schools provides the impetus for further efforts in understanding the transformational changes needed and challenges ahead at the classroom, school, and district levels.","",,"",,,"",""

Applying an inclusive social-cognitive perspective, the study integrated the personal, organizational, and leadership domains to explain teachers' task performance, discretionary performance, and career aspirations. The three domains, represented by the independent variables of self-efficacy, collective efficacy, perceived organizational support, and principal leadership styles, predicted teachers' work performance and career aspirations. Participants included 897 public school teachers in a southern state in the United States. The data gathering instrument incorporated several previously validated scales on study constructs. The analyses indicated that teacher self-efficacy, collective efficacy, POS, and principal transformational leadership all significantly predicted the teachers' task performance, discretionary performance, and career aspirations. Study findings suggest directions for future research on factors influencing teachers' work performance and career aspirations.","",,"",,,"",""

For this reason, the research has three objectives: i) to describe the activities carried out by school principals; ii) to identify who accompanies the principals in the different activities; iii) to analyze the relationship between the management activities and the school's performance. We have opted for a quantitative study in which the daily practices of 42 principals of schools with good school performance and 42 principals of schools with low school performance are analyzed, according to the results of the National Tests. A Daily Record was used to identify the frequency of execution of activities. On the other hand, a scale was used to measure the school climate. The results indicate that the principals of the different groups formed, distributed the management time in the 10 directive activities identified, giving as a result that the activities to which the principals invested more time were: 1) Non-schools; 2) Relations with students; 3) Instructional Leadership and Goal Planning. The activities that received the least amount of time were: 1) Professional growth; 2) Finance; 3) Infrastructure. In relation to the types of accompaniment that the school principals had, in the group of schools classified by their performance and by the school climate, no differences were obtained. The principals carried out this activity with the following types of accompaniment First, alone (without accompaniment); second, accompanied by lead teachers, facilitators, and teachers. Thirdly, with vendors and contractors. Finally, there was no strong correlation between the activities carried out by the director and school performance.","",,"",,,"",""
rayyan-304196007,Reviewing Reviews of Research in Educational Leadership: An Empirical Assessment,2014.0,1,1,,,,,,"Hallinger, P",,,,,"Purpose: Reviews of research play a critical but underappreciated role in knowledge production and accumulation. Yet, until relatively recently, limited attention has been given to the ""methodology"" of conducting reviews of research. This observation also applies in educational leadership and management where reviews of research have charted intellectual progress since the field's inception in the 1950s and 1960s. This paper was framed as a ""methodological review of reviews of research"" in educational leadership and management. Method: The author analyzed 38 reviews of research in educational leadership published in nine international refereed journals over the past 52 years. The author applies a conceptual framework and analytical rubric for conducting systematic reviews of research in analyzing this sample of research reviews. Data analysis focuses on describing methodological characteristics, illuminating patterns of strength and weakness in review methods, and identifying a set of exemplary reviews. Findings: Despite publication of a number of ""exemplary reviews,"" there remains considerable room for improvement in the methodology of conducting systematic reviews of research in educational leadership and management. The study identified a tendency for research reviews in this field to omit key information concerning the rationale and nature of the studies included in the reviews, methods of data collection, extraction, evaluation and analysis, and how these choices impacted interpretation of the findings. Implications: This comprehensive set of 38 published review articles tracks the historical development of the field and, by itself, represents a rich harvest from the study. Within this historical corpus of reviews, the study identified a subset of ""exemplary reviews"" that can serve as useful models for future scholarship. Finally, by identifying patterns of methodological strength and weakness among the reviews as a group, the report offers empirically grounded recommendations for strengthening future reviews of research in educational leadership and management.","",,"",,,"",""
rayyan-304196008,Transformative Leadership: Working for Equity in Diverse Contexts,2010.0,1,1,,,,,,"Shields, CM",,,,,"Purpose: The purpose of this article is twofold: to delineate a theory of transformative leadership, distinct from other theories ( transformational or transactional leadership); and to assess the utility of the theory for guiding the practice of educational leaders who want to effect both educational and broader social change. Approach and Methods: This article is both conceptual and empirical. The delineation of transformative leadership theory is conceptual and draws on its historical and more recent theoretical roots. To investigate it empirically, the author identified two principals from a larger study and, using a backward mapping approach, attempted to determine, using Evers and Wu's ( 2006) abductive reasoning, whether transformative leadership might include ""inference to the best explanation"" ( p. 518) for their practices. Participants, Data Collection, and Analysis: Using a set of predetermined criteria, the author selected two principals from a wider study of educators' pedagogical conceptions of social justice. The two were studied, using multiple interviews, confirmatory interviews with others, and observations in situ, to identify practices that might conform to categories of transformative leadership theory. Findings and Implications: Transformative leadership begins with questions of justice and democracy, critiques inequitable practices, and addresses both individual and public good. The author traced the practices of these principals to determine whether they were consistent with these and other elements of transformative leadership. She then considered alternate explanations and inferred from the data the best fit for transformative leadership, thus supporting its relevance for leadership for equity, deep democracy, and social justice.","",,"",,,"",""

The review sought to document the size, growth trajectory, and geographic distribution of EA research, identify high impact scholars and documents, and illuminate the ""intellectual structure"" of the field. Although science mapping has been applied widely in science, medicine, and social sciences, it is still new in the field of education. The authors identified 22,361 peer-reviewed articles published in 22 Scopus-indexed EA journals between 1960 and 2018. The authors used VOSviewer, Excel, and Tableau software to analyze the data set. The review found that the EA knowledge base has grown dramatically since 1960 with an accelerating rate growth and increasing gender and geographic diversity during the past two decades. Using co-citation analysis, the review identified canonical documents, defined as highly influential documents whose impact has been sustained for a period of several decades. The review also identified four key Schools of Thought that have emerged over time focusing on Leadership for Learning, Leadership and Cultural Change, School Effectiveness and School Improvement, and Leading Teachers. More broadly, our findings highlighted a paradigm shift from ""school administration"" to ""school leadership"" over the course of the six decades. Another significant finding identified ""leadership for student learning and development"" as the ""cognitive anchor"" of the intellectual structure of the EA knowledge base. The authors conclude that science mapping offers a new and useful means of unpacking the historical development of fields of study.","",,"",,,"",""
