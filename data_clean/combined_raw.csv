The study sought to examine the influence of transformational leader behavior by school principals as it related to organizational commitment, organizational citizenship behavior, teacher satisfaction with leader, and student academic performance. Attitudinal and behavioral data were collected from both teachers and principals; student academic performance was collected from school records. School level analyses showed that transformational leadership had significant add‐on effects to transactional leadership in the prediction of organizational commitment, organizational citizenship behavior, and teacher satisfaction. Moreover, transformational leadership was found to have indirect effects on student academic achievement. Finally, it was found that transactional leadership had little add‐on effect on transformational leadership in predicting outcomes. Implications and directions for future research are discussed.

The instructional leadership model refers to the role and the functions of school leadership to employ different management tasks with regards to teaching and learning. Instructional leadership role includes (a) developing mission and goals, (b) managing the educational production function, (c) promoting an academic learning climate, and (d) developing a supportive work environment. Instructional leaders were described as leading from a combination of both expertise and charisma focused primarily on the improvement of student learning outcomes. The monograph, entitled Instructional Leadership and Effective Teaching and Learning and written by Nazmi Xhomara, is dedicated to school instructional leadership as an important factor that influences teaching and learning at school. In the first chapter, the author presents and analyzes educational leadership vs educational management, as well as models of educational leadership and management. The author argues on the importance of different leadership models, such as managerial leadership, transformational leadership, participative leadership, interpersonal leadership, transactional leadership, postmodern leadership, moral leadership, and contingent leadership. Chapters Two, Three, and Four shed light on instructional leadership and teaching and learning, understanding of instructional leadership, the concept and practice of instructional leadership, instructional school leadership and learning environment, attributes of instructional leaders, instructional excellence, instructional leadership time management, effective teaching and teachers, as well as teaching challenges and learning environment. Meanwhile, the author has analyzed constructivism, student intelligence, understanding of supervision, instructional collegial supervision, supervision approaches, understanding of evaluation of teaching and learning, teacher evaluation, and instructional observing instruments in chapters Five, Six, and Seven. Chapters Eight and Nine are focused especially on the research work of the relationships between instructional leadership and teaching, learning, and students' achievements, as well as on an empirical study designed and conducted in Albania as a case. Chapters Ten and Eleven are dedicated to instructional leadership preparation and the future of instructional leadership. As a conclusion, Xhomara indicates that principals are responsible for developing school climates and cultures that support the very best instructional practices. The new era of instructional leadership has predictably placed significant demands for accountability for student success and equity on the principal as well as for the university programs that prepare them. Working in twenty-first-century schools, the instructional leader is held more accountable than ever for student success. © 2021 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc. All rights reserved."

Many schools around the globe are suffering from a shortage of experienced and competent school leaders that can bring about positive change and increase student achievement. Thus, the objective of this study was to determine the correlation between leadership practices, school culture, and student achievement in an effort to build the capacity of principal leaders. A correlational design was used to determine the relationship between principal leadership practices, culture, and achievement in elementary, middle, and high schools. A total of 216 teachers in 31 schools completed the Leadership Practices Inventory and School Culture Survey. A significant correlation was found between (a) leadership practices and school culture and (b) school culture and student achievement. No relationship was established between leadership practices and school culture. The results implied that school leaders who use transformational leadership practices indirectly impact student achievement through creating a positive school culture. It is recommended that principal preparation programs revamp leadership curriculum to develop leaders who can create positive school cultures and manage reform efforts. © The Turkish Online Journal of Educational Technology."

This chapter synthesizes information from various studies of principal instructional leadership since its inception in the 1980s, its subjection to the various changes that happen in schools during the accountability era and school-based management period, as well as the rising and waning of various theories, to show how it is influenced leading to its evolution into 'leadership for learning' which is also known as 'leading learning'. The original model of instructional leadership is initially described and how the subsequent transformational leadership, distributed leadership, and teacher leadership are incorporated into the original instructional leadership theory to produce an integrated leadership for learning were also elaborated. This chapter re-visits the belief and importance placed on school leadership in addition to its crucial role in students' academic achievement and school improvement. Based on reviews of earlier leadership theories, more insights into leadership across different contexts and professional activities can illustrate some of the benefits of such an approach. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2023.

Moreover, there is a significant inconclusive body of literature on the most dominant leadership model (instructional (IL) and transformational (TL) in determining the coherence of school improvement and student academic achievement. Hence, the current study extended the knowledge by examining the impact of IL and TL on implementing the School Improvement Programme (SIP) in the Ethiopian context designed to foster students’ academic performance. This study randomly sampled and surveyed 2880 public secondary school teachers and 70 principals. The study’s findings suggested that school principals’ personal information, gender, academic qualification, and leadership experience determine their leadership style, the coherence of SIP, and school performance. Unlike previous evidence, this study’s findings shed light on the principals’ IL and TL practice, which significantly impacted students’ academic achievement through the mediating role of coherent SIP. © 2025 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."

It was developed in the Cooperative University of Colombia, a country where technical and technological programmes have been promoted in the past 10 years through institutions of higher education. We build on the idea that knowing the leadership styles of teachers and principals is fundamental. The main objective of the study is thus to formulate achievement strategies to improve the educative centre and the educational community at several levels: as individuals, as groups and as an organization. To this aim we conducted a descriptive research with a non-experimental design by the poll method, through the implementation of the ‘Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire by Bass and Avolio–MLQ’ instrument, administered to teachers and principals of technical-technological programmes of the Cooperative University of Colombia. Results show that the elements of Transformational Leadership are predominant over the other types of Leadership. They thus emerge as the key element to strengthen, through individual training processes and organizational improvement strategies, in order to achieve optimal organizational results. This must be carried out from within the educational entity, through the motivation of students and work groups, strengthening the practices of teachers and principals in the development of basic organizational and academic functions. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."
data_rawScopus_2025-08-22_TL_AcademicAchievement_19.ris,ris,Connection between Taiwanese research on school leadership and global scholarship: A bibliometric review,"Pan, H.-L.W.; Chen, W.-Y.",2021,Journal of Research in Education Sciences,10.6209/jories.202106_66(2).0006,,"1. Background Systematic reviews may inform public policies and contribute to the building of a knowledge base. However, reviews of school leadership research are relatively rare in Taiwan. This study conducted a bibliometric review to analyze journal papers by Taiwanese scholars in the Scopus database published in the previous 20 years. The focus was to examine the connection between Taiwanese and global research on school leadership. 2. Research questions On the basis of the research background, four research questions were proposed: (1) What is the volume and growth trajectory of Taiwanese school leadership research?(2) What is the international visibility of Taiwanese school leadership research as revealed through citation analysis? (3) What are the main topics covered by Taiwanese school leadership research and how do they correspond to the global trend? (4) What is the intellectual structure of Taiwanese school leadership research and how do it connect with the global literature? 3. Theoretical framework (1) Intellectual development of school leadership research The theory movement in the 1950s and 1960s highlighted the development of educational administration research. Griffiths (1959) categorized these theories into four groups: social system and role theory, leadership theory, decision theory, and organizational theory. In the 1970s,contingency theory, which emphasizes the influence of context on leadership, was proposed. With the growing interest in school effectiveness and school reform, the organizational perspective was applied to investigate school leadership. Instructional leadership was also emphasized from then on. In the 1990s, other leadership approaches such as transformational leadership, moral leadership, and distributed leadership became popular in school leadership research. With the power paradigm shifting from a heroic view of leaders to a more dispersed view of power, distributed leadership and teacher leadership were also highly recognized. In response to the international context, leadership for learning, which includes elements of instructional leadership, transformational leadership, and shared leadership, has gained global attention in the new millennium. (2) Retrospective view of school leadership research Systematic reviews did not appear in the field of educational administration until the 1980s. EPPI-Centre (2012) indicated the four key features of systematic reviews. First, a high quality systematic review is explicit and is conducted using transparent methods. Second, it follows a standard set of stages. Third, the review is accountable, replicable, and updateable. Fourth, users should be involved to ensure reports are relevant and useful. The elements of reviews include the central topics of interest, guiding questions, and goals; a conceptual perspective for guiding there view’s selection, evaluation, and interpretation of the studies; sources and types of data; data evaluation and analysis; and the major results of the review (Hallinger, 2014). However, according to Hallinger’s study in 2014, only eight reviews met these criteria. Of the eight studies, some used critical synthesis, some adopted meta-analysis, and some employed both. In recent years, network analysis, data mining, and bibliometric analysis are increasingly being applied in systematic reviews. In addition to a greater diversity in methods, the regions under review have expanded from the United States and United Kingdom to many other regions. This development can be attributed to Hallinger’s effort to initiate international collaboration to build the knowledge base of educational leadership in Asia. Because of the growing interest in the academic development in non-Western countries, he promoted the use of systematic reviews to examine studies in Asia, Africa, Saudi Arabia, and Central and South America, which resulted in more than 30 systematic reviews on educational leadership and management. A wide range of research topics is a prominent feature of educational leadership and management research. Five topics that have gained frequent attention are social justice, female leadership, school leadership preparation and development, trust, and instruction and instructional leadership. The following are the topics of frontier research in this field: principal, school leadership, and student achievement; distributed leadership, instructional leadership, teacher learning, accountability, school improvement, school reform, and leadership development; and race, justice, and urban education. In Taiwan, research reviews on educational leadership are scant. According to Lin’s (2000) review, only a few studies have focused on the impact of principals on students. Pan’s (2010) review indicated that of all the educational leadership studies in government-funded projects and journals,70% of the topics were related to principals’ leadership styles and behaviors. The distribution of the research topics was not sufficiently diversified to reflect global academic development. 4. Research method This study used bibliometric analysis on the Scopus database to analyze Taiwanese school leadership research. The review process was based on the steps of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) developed by Moher et al. (2009). After the process of screening, identification, eligibility determination, and inclusion, 95 papers were included for analysis. Descriptive analysis, citation analysis, co-occurrence analysis of keywords, and co-citation analysis were conducted to address the research questions. 5. Research findings The study had the following three key findings: (1) Concerning the volume of publication in journals, the first English paper on Taiwanese school leadership research did not appear until 2001.Although the promotion of the world university rankings and the launch of the Top University Project have changed the trend of solely using Chinese for academic writing, the number of English studies on school leadership remains limited. Moreover, only 14.7% of papers are published in the core journals of education leadership and management. (2) A citation analysis revealed that the international visibility of Taiwanese school leadership research is low. The average number of papers of the 10 most cited Taiwanese scholars is 3.5, and they have been cited an average of 45.2times. The number of citations of Taiwanese scholars is 3.33 times less than that of African educational leadership research and 11.78 times less than that of research on three emerging regions. (3) The research topics selected by Taiwanese scholars may highlight international academic development; however, some underdeveloped topics remain such as social justice leadership, organizational theory, institutional theory, and social capital. The current co-citation analysis revealed the four schools of thought of Taiwanese school leadership, namely leadership for learning, distributed forms of leadership, leadership behavior and its impact, and social network. 6. Contributions Systematic reviews on school leadership are scarce in Taiwan. The present study conducted a 206 bibliometric analysis to examine the development and features of Taiwanese school leadership literature which is innovative in the research method. The connection between Taiwanese studies on school leadership research and global scholarship has seldom been addressed in relevant research. The current analysis presents the development of Taiwanese school leadership and its connection with global trends, providing critical insights and directions for future research on school leadership in Taiwan. 7. Implications The present findings indicate the future direction of Taiwanese academic development in the field of educational administration. First, publishing more research in English can help increase the international impact of Taiwanese scholars. Greater exposure in English publications can highlight the fruitful outcome of Taiwanese school leadership research internationally. Building the academic connections between Taiwan and other countries will also be beneficial. Second, the current study identified a gap between Taiwanese school leadership research and the global trend. Including more diversified topics may help broaden the scope of research. Some topics recommended for future study include social justice leadership, organizational theory, institutional theory, social capital theory, social justice theory, and critical racialism. Third, conducting periodic replication studies using bibliometric analysis may help track the development of Taiwanese school leadership research. In particular, this method allows for a comparison of the distinguishing features of research among different periods. Fourth, a bibliometric analysis on Taiwanese school leadership research published in Chinese would be of considerable value. Taiwan has several literature databases that collect domestic research. However, the data structure provides insufficient information for an effective bibliometric analysis. To maximize the usefulness of these databases, their data structure design merits special consideration. © 2021, National Taiwan Normal University. All rights reserved."

Information and Communication Technology (ICT) leadership supports effective instructional practices through a combination of interpersonal skills, knowledge of a variety of current technology applications, and the vision to anticipate future technology-based solutions for education. The potential benefits of good ICT leadership can include improved academic achievement by students, improved student attendance and reduced attrition, better vocational preparation of students, more efficient administrative operations, and reduced teacher/staff burnout and turnover. The main objectives of this study are to investigate principals’ ICT leadership practices in their respective colleges and the methods and strategies principals use to lead technology integration into the educational environment. Qualitative as well as quantitative data were collected by means of semi-structured interviews and questionnaires that were administered to teachers and principals of professional colleges. This study reveals that technology integration as an instructional strategy needs to be learned in the wider context of changing pedagogy and paradigms of thought about technology use in education. Principals who effectively lead ICT integration within their colleges classically perform well in leadership and management, vision and goal setting, student learning, teaching, professional development and training, operations and infrastructure support, and assessment and evaluation. © Springer India 2014."

The second meta-analysis involved a comparison of the effects of five inductively derived sets of leadership practices on student outcomes. Twelve of the studies contributed to this second analysis. Findings: The first meta-analysis indicated that the average effect of instructional leadership on student outcomes was three to four times that of transformational leadership. Inspection of the survey items used to measure school leadership revealed five sets of leadership practices or dimensions: establishing goals and expectations; resourcing strategically; planning, coordinating, and evaluating teaching and the curriculum; promoting and participating in teacher learning and development, and ensuring an orderly and supportive environment. The second meta-analysis revealed strong average effects for the leadership dimension involving promoting and participating in teacher learning and development and moderate effects for the dimensions concerned with goal setting and planning, coordinating, and evaluating teaching and the curriculum. Conclusions and Implications for Research and Practice: The comparisons between transformational and instructional leadership and between the five leadership dimensions suggested that the more leaders focus their relationships, their work, and their learning on the core business of teaching and learning, the greater their influence on student outcomes.

Utilizing a systematic grounded theory method (SGTM), we conducted research in the provinces of Amasya, Çorum, Samsun, and Tokat in Türkiye. Purposeful and theoretical sampling methods were employed to recruit successful school principals, deputy principals, teachers, students, and parents from secondary schools affiliated with the Ministry of National Education (MoNE). The data draws on unstructured individual and focus group interviews, as well as documents and observations. All the data obtained were inductively analyzed through open, axis, and selective coding stages. Based on the codes, sub-categories, categories, themes, and dimensions from the analyses, we designed the Contextual Successful School Principalship Model (CSSPM), which falls into four dimensions as follows: individual, managerial, organizational, and instructional. SSPs in this study mostly tend to display paternalistic leadership attitudes and behaviors in terms of dedication and self-sacrifice, serving, intrinsic motivation, and influencing stakeholders. They exhibit almost all the attitudes and behaviors of servant leadership, act according to some national and moral values, and experience national attitudes such as patriotism and nationalism intensely. By giving importance to the academic socialization of students' mothers, successful school principals exhibit transformational and instructional leadership behaviors. They act strategically to directly involve mothers in enhancing student achievement, demonstrating their commitment to fostering an inclusive and supportive educational environment. © 2024, Ozgen Korkmaz.

Research Methods: The schools were selected from a geographically stratified sample of public middle schools in a state in the southeastern United States. Multiple linear regression was used to identify schools performing better than expected considering their levels of poverty and other school-related factors. The final three schools, one from each geographic region, showed steady increases in academic achievement and school climate following the arrival of their principals. Data were primarily collected from interviews with principals, teaching and nonteaching staff, and parents using protocols adapted from the International Successful School Principalship Project. Findings: The findings explicate the large degree to which the leadership practices and beliefs that influenced student achievement in these schools were adapted to and commensurate with each school's immediate context. Furthermore, they illustrate how principals used these practices to institutionalize school-wide reform efforts as vehicles for leading change within their schools. Implications: The findings substantiate research on successful school leadership in high-needs middle schools. They also extend this research by examining the way core transformational and instructional leadership practices can be adapted to suit various school contexts and institutionalize school-wide reform efforts to enhance student learning. Further research is required to understand how principals decide to adapt their leadership practices, and how aspiring leaders can best learn to do so. © The University Council for Educational Administration 2013."

Design/methodology/approach: A quantitative approach with a post-positive paradigm was followed. A systematic random sample of 72 secondary schools in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, was selected. The Cronbach’s α coefficient, statistical significance (p-values) and effect size (d-values) were calculated, and a factor analysis was conducted. Findings: The results show a difference between teachers and principals regarding the transformational leadership style. The principals in the high-performing schools were perceived as less passive-avoidant in practice than those in the low-performing schools. A principal manages and leads a school effectively by applying an appropriate leadership style. Research limitations/implications: For future research, it will be advisable to make use of a mixed-method design. Although the Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire addressed numerous aspects of leadership and leadership styles, the “voice” of the respondents lacked. Furthermore, more leadership styles could be investigated in different contexts. Practical implications: A chosen principal leadership style is not necessarily the best style for this purpose. School principals and teachers interpret leadership styles differently. Communication is therefore important. Social implications: The principal leadership style is not always necessarily the teachers’ and learners’ choice. It is important that schools keep up with a constantly changing world. Originality/value: If school principals and teachers agree upon a specific leadership style, there may be better collaboration which enhances better academic performance as well as effectiveness regarding schools. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited."

After teachers and teaching, school leadership is the most important determinant of learner achievement in school. Despite this, there is still uncertainty regarding what successful school leadership is and what successful school leaders do in non-Western contexts. In this mixed methods study I explored successful high school leadership in South Africa. Specifically, a questionnaire was administered to 38 principals from academically high-achieving schools from a range of socioeconomic contexts throughout the Western Cape, and 14 principals were interviewed. An integrated analysis reveals the paradox of uniqueness and universality of successful school leadership in South Africa, outlining that while there is no single best approach, various similarities exist between successful school leaders and established international literature. I found that successful principals adapt to their context, amalgamate transformational, instructional and distributed leadership styles, set direction, develop people, constantly realign the school with teaching and learning, and, importantly, strive to make a difference in the lives of others. It is about leading with Ubuntu. By highlighting these characteristics and practices, I offer theoretical, practical and personal advice to current and aspiring school leaders, academics and policy makers. © 2023, South African Journal Of Education.

Results from meta-analytic structural equation modelling (MASEM),"Özdoğru, M.; Tülübaş, T.; Karakose, T.; Kanadlı, S.; Kardas, A.; Papadakis, S.",2025,Acta Psychologica,10.1016/j.actpsy.2025.105144,,"Principal leadership behaviors affect the improvement of school outcomes significantly, not only by providing psychological and professional support for teachers but also by facilitating a positive learning environment at school. This has cultivated both policy and research interest in understanding how principals' leadership behaviors can leverage student outcomes both directly and indirectly through teachers. In this quest, three leadership models have become prominent due to their close relation to classroom instruction and learning: instructional, transformational, and distributed leadership. The current study aims to reveal the relationships between these leadership behaviors of principals and student outcomes as well as assess the mediating effect of teacher self-efficacy on this relationship. Utilizing meta-analytic structural equation modelling (MASEM) methodology, the study analyzes data from prior studies to offer a more comprehensive and holistic analysis of the complex relationships between the variables. The analysis of data from 90 studies showed that all three leadership behaviors affected student outcomes both directly and indirectly through teacher self-efficacy. They also had a moderate direct influence on teacher self-efficacy, while teacher self-efficacy had a moderate effect on student outcomes. These results reiterate the significance of principals' leadership for learning to facilitate student outcomes and suggest that the integrated practice of leadership in accordance with contextual requirements could leverage the effectiveness and improvement of schools. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."

Successful implementation of DLI programs requires educational leaders, particularly principals, to embrace a shared, asset-oriented vision. This chapter explores the attributes of effective DLI principals and key considerations for leadership teams during the planning and implementation phases. Drawing on two qualitative studies, this chapter examines the distinct traits of principals in DLI programs, and the essential steps needed to ensure bilingualism for both English learners and native English speakers. Effective DLI principals demonstrate a commitment to multilingualism, advocate for students from diverse backgrounds, and exhibit the courage to lead transformational change. Successful program implementation depends on ongoing planning and active community engagement. The chapter concludes that strong leadership in DLI programs is critical for closing achievement gaps and ensuring equitable outcomes for all students. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."

Hence, the current study extended the knowledge by examining the impact of IL and TL on implementing the School Improvement Programme (SIP) in the Ethiopian context designed to foster students’ academic performance. This study randomly sampled and surveyed 2880 public secondary school teachers and 70 principals. The study’s findings suggested that school principals’ personal information, gender, academic qualification, and leadership experience determine their leadership style, the coherence of SIP, and school performance.

Materials/methods: With this purpose, a meta-analysis of data gathered from a total of 90 empirical studies including 83,337 participants was performed. The random effects model was utilized to measure the overall effect sizes. Results: The results showed that leadership and school climate had a moderate effect on academic achievement. In the USA context, organizational climate, principal leadership, and teacher leadership affected student achievement respectively. However, in the Turkish context, teacher leadership had a greater influence on student achievement the school climate, and principal leadership. The analysis also revealed that the influence of leadership on student achievement was attained through transformational, supportive, distributed, and instructional leadership practices respectively. Among the moderators tested, only the education level was determined to moderate the effect of school climate on student achievement. It was also concluded that an open organizational climate in primary schools had a greater effect on academic achievement.

Utilizing a systematic grounded theory method (SGTM), we conducted research in the provinces of Amasya, Çorum, Samsun, and Tokat in Türkiye. Purposeful and theoretical sampling methods were employed to recruit successful school principals, deputy principals, teachers, students, and parents from secondary schools affiliated with the Ministry of National Education (MoNE). The data draws on unstructured individual and focus group interviews, as well as documents and observations. All the data obtained were inductively analyzed through open, axis, and selective coding stages. Based on the codes, sub-categories, categories, themes, and dimensions from the analyses, we designed the Contextual Successful School Principalship Model (CSSPM), which falls into four dimensions as follows: individual, managerial, organizational, and instructional. SSPs in this study mostly tend to display paternalistic leadership attitudes and behaviors in terms of dedication and self-sacrifice, serving, intrinsic motivation, and influencing stakeholders. They exhibit almost all the attitudes and behaviors of servant leadership, act according to some national and moral values, and experience national attitudes such as patriotism and nationalism intensely. By giving importance to the academic socialization of students' mothers, successful school principals exhibit transformational and instructional leadership behaviors. They act strategically to directly involve mothers in enhancing student achievement, demonstrating their commitment to fostering an inclusive and supportive educational environment. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."

In this research, we examined the relationship between integrated leadership and teacher professional learning and teacher practices in Turkey, where educational policy makers have recently introduced several school reform initiatives. More specifically, we aimed to examine the moderating function of transformational leadership in the relationship between instructional leadership and teacher practices, with an emphasis on the mediating role of teacher professional learning. Research Design: We conducted this study with a cross-sectional design and moderated mediation model. Data collected from 616 teachers working in a mix of primary and secondary schools in Turkey were analyzed using structural equation modeling and bootstrapping tests. Findings: We found evidence that transformational leadership acted as a moderator of the indirect effect of principal instructional leadership on teachers' instructional practices through teacher professional learning. Implications: This study adds to the accumulated body of knowledge on the effects of school leadership by concluding that the effect of instructional leadership on teacher learning and practice is contingent upon the extent to which principals enact transformational leadership. School principals who adopt a more comprehensive leadership approach that combines instructional leadership and transformational leadership practices can maximize their effects on student achievement through teacher learning, and better address the ever-growing demands of educational reforms. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."

The instructional leadership model refers to the role and the functions of school leadership to employ different management tasks with regards to teaching and learning. Instructional leadership role includes (a) developing mission and goals, (b) managing the educational production function, (c) promoting an academic learning climate, and (d) developing a supportive work environment. Instructional leaders were described as leading from a combination of both expertise and charisma focused primarily on the improvement of student learning outcomes. The monograph, entitled Instructional Leadership and Effective Teaching and Learning and written by Nazmi Xhomara, is dedicated to school instructional leadership as an important factor that influences teaching and learning at school. In the first chapter, the author presents and analyzes educational leadership vs educational management, as well as models of educational leadership and management. The author argues on the importance of different leadership models, such as managerial leadership, transformational leadership, participative leadership, interpersonal leadership, transactional leadership, postmodern leadership, moral leadership, and contingent leadership. Chapters Two, Three, and Four shed light on instructional leadership and teaching and learning, understanding of instructional leadership, the concept and practice of instructional leadership, instructional school leadership and learning environment, attributes of instructional leaders, instructional excellence, instructional leadership time management, effective teaching and teachers, as well as teaching challenges and learning environment. Meanwhile, the author has analyzed constructivism, student intelligence, understanding of supervision, instructional collegial supervision, supervision approaches, understanding of evaluation of teaching and learning, teacher evaluation, and instructional observing instruments in chapters Five, Six, and Seven. Chapters Eight and Nine are focused especially on the research work of the relationships between instructional leadership and teaching, learning, and students' achievements, as well as on an empirical study designed and conducted in Albania as a case. Chapters Ten and Eleven are dedicated to instructional leadership preparation and the future of instructional leadership. As a conclusion, Xhomara indicates that principals are responsible for developing school climates and cultures that support the very best instructional practices. The new era of instructional leadership has predictably placed significant demands for accountability for student success and equity on the principal as well as for the university programs that prepare them. Working in twenty-first-century schools, the instructional leader is held more accountable than ever for student success. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."
data_rawScopus_2025-08-22_TL_Achievement_46.ris,ris,Connection between Taiwanese research on school leadership and global scholarship: A bibliometric review,"Pan, H.-L.W.; Chen, W.-Y.",2021,Journal of Research in Education Sciences,10.6209/jories.202106_66(2).0006,,"1. Background Systematic reviews may inform public policies and contribute to the building of a knowledge base. However, reviews of school leadership research are relatively rare in Taiwan. This study conducted a bibliometric review to analyze journal papers by Taiwanese scholars in the Scopus database published in the previous 20 years. The focus was to examine the connection between Taiwanese and global research on school leadership. 2. Research questions On the basis of the research background, four research questions were proposed: (1) What is the volume and growth trajectory of Taiwanese school leadership research?(2) What is the international visibility of Taiwanese school leadership research as revealed through citation analysis? (3) What are the main topics covered by Taiwanese school leadership research and how do they correspond to the global trend? (4) What is the intellectual structure of Taiwanese school leadership research and how do it connect with the global literature? 3. Theoretical framework (1) Intellectual development of school leadership research The theory movement in the 1950s and 1960s highlighted the development of educational administration research. Griffiths (1959) categorized these theories into four groups: social system and role theory, leadership theory, decision theory, and organizational theory. In the 1970s,contingency theory, which emphasizes the influence of context on leadership, was proposed. With the growing interest in school effectiveness and school reform, the organizational perspective was applied to investigate school leadership. Instructional leadership was also emphasized from then on. In the 1990s, other leadership approaches such as transformational leadership, moral leadership, and distributed leadership became popular in school leadership research. With the power paradigm shifting from a heroic view of leaders to a more dispersed view of power, distributed leadership and teacher leadership were also highly recognized. In response to the international context, leadership for learning, which includes elements of instructional leadership, transformational leadership, and shared leadership, has gained global attention in the new millennium. (2) Retrospective view of school leadership research Systematic reviews did not appear in the field of educational administration until the 1980s. EPPI-Centre (2012) indicated the four key features of systematic reviews. First, a high quality systematic review is explicit and is conducted using transparent methods. Second, it follows a standard set of stages. Third, the review is accountable, replicable, and updateable. Fourth, users should be involved to ensure reports are relevant and useful. The elements of reviews include the central topics of interest, guiding questions, and goals; a conceptual perspective for guiding there view’s selection, evaluation, and interpretation of the studies; sources and types of data; data evaluation and analysis; and the major results of the review (Hallinger, 2014). However, according to Hallinger’s study in 2014, only eight reviews met these criteria. Of the eight studies, some used critical synthesis, some adopted meta-analysis, and some employed both. In recent years, network analysis, data mining, and bibliometric analysis are increasingly being applied in systematic reviews. In addition to a greater diversity in methods, the regions under review have expanded from the United States and United Kingdom to many other regions. This development can be attributed to Hallinger’s effort to initiate international collaboration to build the knowledge base of educational leadership in Asia. Because of the growing interest in the academic development in non-Western countries, he promoted the use of systematic reviews to examine studies in Asia, Africa, Saudi Arabia, and Central and South America, which resulted in more than 30 systematic reviews on educational leadership and management. A wide range of research topics is a prominent feature of educational leadership and management research. Five topics that have gained frequent attention are social justice, female leadership, school leadership preparation and development, trust, and instruction and instructional leadership. The following are the topics of frontier research in this field: principal, school leadership, and student achievement; distributed leadership, instructional leadership, teacher learning, accountability, school improvement, school reform, and leadership development; and race, justice, and urban education. In Taiwan, research reviews on educational leadership are scant. According to Lin’s (2000) review, only a few studies have focused on the impact of principals on students. Pan’s (2010) review indicated that of all the educational leadership studies in government-funded projects and journals,70% of the topics were related to principals’ leadership styles and behaviors. The distribution of the research topics was not sufficiently diversified to reflect global academic development. 4. Research method This study used bibliometric analysis on the Scopus database to analyze Taiwanese school leadership research. The review process was based on the steps of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) developed by Moher et al. (2009). After the process of screening, identification, eligibility determination, and inclusion, 95 papers were included for analysis. Descriptive analysis, citation analysis, co-occurrence analysis of keywords, and co-citation analysis were conducted to address the research questions. 5. Research findings The study had the following three key findings: (1) Concerning the volume of publication in journals, the first English paper on Taiwanese school leadership research did not appear until 2001.Although the promotion of the world university rankings and the launch of the Top University Project have changed the trend of solely using Chinese for academic writing, the number of English studies on school leadership remains limited. Moreover, only 14.7% of papers are published in the core journals of education leadership and management. (2) A citation analysis revealed that the international visibility of Taiwanese school leadership research is low. The average number of papers of the 10 most cited Taiwanese scholars is 3.5, and they have been cited an average of 45.2times. The number of citations of Taiwanese scholars is 3.33 times less than that of African educational leadership research and 11.78 times less than that of research on three emerging regions. (3) The research topics selected by Taiwanese scholars may highlight international academic development; however, some underdeveloped topics remain such as social justice leadership, organizational theory, institutional theory, and social capital. The current co-citation analysis revealed the four schools of thought of Taiwanese school leadership, namely leadership for learning, distributed forms of leadership, leadership behavior and its impact, and social network. 6. Contributions Systematic reviews on school leadership are scarce in Taiwan. The present study conducted a 206 bibliometric analysis to examine the development and features of Taiwanese school leadership literature which is innovative in the research method. The connection between Taiwanese studies on school leadership research and global scholarship has seldom been addressed in relevant research. The current analysis presents the development of Taiwanese school leadership and its connection with global trends, providing critical insights and directions for future research on school leadership in Taiwan. 7. Implications The present findings indicate the future direction of Taiwanese academic development in the field of educational administration. First, publishing more research in English can help increase the international impact of Taiwanese scholars. Greater exposure in English publications can highlight the fruitful outcome of Taiwanese school leadership research internationally. Building the academic connections between Taiwan and other countries will also be beneficial. Second, the current study identified a gap between Taiwanese school leadership research and the global trend. Including more diversified topics may help broaden the scope of research. Some topics recommended for future study include social justice leadership, organizational theory, institutional theory, social capital theory, social justice theory, and critical racialism. Third, conducting periodic replication studies using bibliometric analysis may help track the development of Taiwanese school leadership research. In particular, this method allows for a comparison of the distinguishing features of research among different periods. Fourth, a bibliometric analysis on Taiwanese school leadership research published in Chinese would be of considerable value. Taiwan has several literature databases that collect domestic research. However, the data structure provides insufficient information for an effective bibliometric analysis. To maximize the usefulness of these databases, their data structure design merits special consideration. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."

This study is a qualitative study with an interactive analysis model on transformational leadership strategies at the international Madrasah Aliyah Amanatul Ummah Mojokerto and the Serpong Insan Cendekia State Madrasah Aliyah. This study concluded that the first strategy to increase the influence of the idealism of the madrasah principal towards an international pesantren-based Madrasah Aliyah is the strong commitment between the principal and teachers, employees, students, as well as parents, beginning with planning (RKM) using school review, quality assurance, benchmarking, and quality control accompanied by exemplary values, an effort to maintain mutual trust as well as the sincerity of all stakeholders. Then, the second strategy is to foster inspirational motivation for the principals of international pesantren-based Madrasah Aliyah which is reflected in the ability of madrasah principals who can motivate and inspire their subordinates to improve the quality of education together. For example, the achievement of madrasah principals, teachers and students winning the international olympiad between 2010-2020 is supported by the principle of Islamic boarding school that is ‘The Islamic Role Model is The First Key to Build Great Leaders’. Furthermore, The third strategy is to strengthen the intellectual stimulus of Madrasah Aliyah’s principal with superior international standards based on Islamic boarding school values, which is reflected in several positive changes made and achieved by the madrasah’s principal, both the quality of the input, process, and output, such as student achievements in national and international levels such as scholarships to the Middle East, Europe, Japan, and Australia. Finally, the last strategy is to transform the madrasah principal’s individualized considereation towards superior international pesantren-based Madrasah Aliyah which is reflected in the ability of madrasah principals in managing human resources appropriately, including managing the right competencies for human resources through the competency development programs for teachers and employees continuously; and improving abilities through training supported by the principles of responsibility and exemplary, which are the characteristics of pesantren. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."

A total of 199 teachers, who taught O-NET and PISA key subjects-45 teachers in English, 77 teachers in science, 77 teachers in math-from the five regions of Thailand representing small, medium, and large school size were recruited through a stratified sampling technique and were asked to rate their principal's transformational school leadership and own transformational classroom leadership. A Thai version of the transformational leadership questionnaire was developed, which consisted of a self-rating and a rater form. Partial Least Square Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) was employed to find the causal relationship, and ANOVA version SPSS 21 was used to compare the SLA among three different school sizes. The study found that transformational school leadership had direct effects on transformational classroom leadership, but transformational classroom leadership did not have a direct effect on English, science, and math teaching. The study also found that large schools had better students' learning achievement compared to small and medium-sized schools, and small-sized schools had the lowest average score in English, science, and math.

The investigator conducted a mixed method study using a survey questionnaire (to include research developed questions and questions from the Belief on Discipline Survey) and an open-ended question. The study examined principals and assistant principals who lead in secondary schools in northern Florida and assessed differences in the implementation of discipline policies between high poverty low-achieving (HPLA) and high poverty high-achieving (HPHA) schools and the impact on student achievement. The study also examined the factors these principals and assistant principals perceived as facilitating and hindering discipline policy. Descriptive statistics were used to examine demographic data. The study used a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) to assess differences in the perceived impact of school discipline policies on student achievement between principals and assistant principals (APs) at HPHA schools and HPLA schools. Qualitative data were analyzed using the constant comparative method. The results of this study suggest there were significant differences in the characteristics of principals and APs serving high poverty (HP) schools, differences in how principals and APs in HP schools perceive their discipline practices in relationship to student success. Also, the findings suggest there are some differences in the qualities of transformational leadership (TL) between principals and APs HPHA and HPLA schools. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."

The descriptive survey design was used for this study whose target population comprised of 130 secondary schools and five Quality Assurance and Standards Officers in Bomet County. Stratified random sampling procedure was adopted to sample out schools as boys’, girls’ and mixed schools; then Slovin’s formula was used to obtain a total of 108 schools. While purposive sampling procedure was applied to choose one Director of Studies from each 108 schools selected and five Quality Assurance and Standards Officers from the five sub-counties in Bomet County. A total sample of 118 respondents from 108 secondary schools and the five sub-counties participated in the study. When collecting the data, instruments used were Director of Studies’ questionnaires, Quality Assurance and Standards Officers’ interview guides, school and Bomet County Director of Education KCSE records. Chi-square test was adopted to establish the relationship between principals’ idealized influence and academic performance and the results showed that principals’ idealized influence had a strong significant relationship with students’ academic performance in KCSE.

The study sought to measure leadership dimensions based on microdata from contextual questionnaires answered by principals and teachers; propose a model that relates leadership dimensions to student achievement as reflected by schools’ IDEB results; and verify the relationships between leadership dimensions and student achievement. To that end, we performed multivariate analyzes, specifically structural equations modeling, on a database containing microdata from Prova Brasil and IDEB values. Results show that it is possible to measure leadership dimensions using these microdata. Based on the conceptual model developed, there is evidence that the relationships developed by the principal within the school have a greater effect on teachers’ commitment to improve teaching and learning, thus indirectly affecting school performance. In addition, school principals have sought to exercise transformational leadership combined with pedagogical leadership, which represents a challenge for them, since it covers many knowledge areas. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."

It was developed in the Cooperative University of Colombia, a country where technical and technological programmes have been promoted in the past 10 years through institutions of higher education. We build on the idea that knowing the leadership styles of teachers and principals is fundamental. The main objective of the study is thus to formulate achievement strategies to improve the educative centre and the educational community at several levels: as individuals, as groups and as an organization. To this aim we conducted a descriptive research with a non-experimental design by the poll method, through the implementation of the ‘Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire by Bass and Avolio–MLQ’ instrument, administered to teachers and principals of technical-technological programmes of the Cooperative University of Colombia. Results show that the elements of Transformational Leadership are predominant over the other types of Leadership. They thus emerge as the key element to strengthen, through individual training processes and organizational improvement strategies, in order to achieve optimal organizational results. This must be carried out from within the educational entity, through the motivation of students and work groups, strengthening the practices of teachers and principals in the development of basic organizational and academic functions. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."

The multiple case study included the application of a questionnaire, semi-structured interviews to members of the principal's work team who participated in the study in the three schools, and the consideration of the score obtained by the establishment in a test used for measuring learning outcomes (SIMCE test). Results suggest that in the case of the three schools, transformational leadership has a positive impact on student outcomes.

Design/methodology/approach – Guided by strong evidence from theories on school leadership and work psychology, the authors hypothesized relations among dimensions of principals’ instructional and transformational leadership behaviors, teachers’ perception of the school climate (social and affective, and physical environment), their job satisfaction and student achievement. The benefits of the principal’s leadership behaviors for student achievement are primarily hypothesized as indirect, with either a weak or statistically non-significant direct positive effect on student outcomes. Path modeling was applied to validate a mediated-effects model using cross-sectional survey data (306 principals, 1,539 teachers) obtained from 306 secondary schools in the two Indian metropolitan cities of New Delhi and Kolkata. Findings – Principal leadership behaviors were not associated directly with either teacher job satisfaction or school-aggregated student achievement. Rather, the transformational leader behavior showed an indirect effect, through the social and affective component of the school climate, on teacher job satisfaction. The physical climate, however, appeared to play a dominating role in mediating the instructional leadership effects on teacher job satisfaction. Comparing the relative indirect effect sizes of the instructional and transformational leadership behaviors on student achievement, principals appear to favor the former approach. Originality/value – This study provides further empirical evidence that instructional leadership better captures the impact of school leadership on student outcomes, when compared to its transformational counterpart. By identifying the relative effects of different leadership practices, school leaders and educational practitioners can focus more on altering the distribution and frequency of those practices that work best for ameliorating student achievement levels. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."

The purpose of this paper is to test a model of integrated transformational leadership including three important school mediators. Design/methodology/approach – In total, 5,392 students provided data on student engagement, and 569 teachers provided survey data on principal leadership and the collective teacher efficacy (CTE) and extra effort of their colleagues. Data were analyzed at the school level (n=51) using mediation analysis with the PROCESS macro to calculate the direct and indirect effects of all of the variables in the serial multiple mediator model. Findings – The model explained a significant amount of variance in both reading (38 percent) and mathematics (35 percent). CTE and student engagement mediated all of the leadership effects, demonstrating the importance of teacher and student relations in school improvement. The combined effect sizes are significantly greater than the effects of earlier TL models. Originality/value – This study contributes to “leadership for learning” research by demonstrating that refining transformational leadership behaviors to include instructional management can enhance a leader’s impact on achievement. As one of the few studies to examine student engagement as a mediator along with teacher mediators, the current study highlights the importance of teacher-student relations in school improvement. While collective efficacy mediated all of the effects of leadership on achievement, student emotional engagement also contributed to mathematics achievement. The study’s findings advance research into mutual influence processes, indicating that reciprocity may extend throughout the leader-teacher-student loop. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."

Research Methods: Empirical data were drawn from a 3-year mixed-methods national study (“Impact Study”) that investigated associations between the work of principals in effective and improving primary and secondary schools in England and student outcomes as defined (but not confined) by their national examination and assessment results over 3 years. The research began with a critical survey of the extant literature, followed by a national survey that explored principals’ and key staff’s perceptions of school improvement strategies and actions that they believed had helped foster better student attainment. This was complemented by multiperspective in-depth case studies of a subsample of 20 schools. Findings: The research provides new empirical evidence of how successful principals directly and indirectly achieve and sustain improvement over time through combining both transformational and instructional leadership strategies. The findings show that schools’ abilities to improve and sustain effectiveness over the long term are not primarily the result of the principals’ leadership style but of their understanding and diagnosis of the school’s needs and their application of clearly articulated, organizationally shared educational values through multiple combinations and accumulations of time and context-sensitive strategies that are “layered” and progressively embedded in the school’s work, culture, and achievements. Implications: Mixed-methods research designs are likely to provide finer grained, more nuanced evidence-based understandings of the leadership roles and behaviors of principals who achieve and sustain educational outcomes in schools than single lens quantitative analyses, meta-analyses, or purely qualitative approaches. The findings themselves provide support for more differentiated, context sensitive training and development for aspiring and serving principals. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."

A Latent Class Analysis of Principal Perception of Leadership,"Urick, A.; Bowers, A.J.",2014,Educational Administration Quarterly,10.1177/0013161x13489019,,"Purpose: Effective styles of principal leadership can help address multiple issues in struggling schools, such as low student achievement and high rates of teacher attrition. Although the literature has nominated certain ""idealized"" leadership styles as being more or less effective, such as transformational, instructional, and shared instructional leadership, we have little evidence about how principals may or may not choose to practice these styles across U.S. schools. Research Design: Latent class analysis was used to identify different types of principals across the United States. We analyzed the 1999-2000 Schools and Staffing Survey as it presents a unique opportunity to study the different types of U.S. principals since it contains leadership measures not found in other national surveys. A final sample of 7,650 public schools and principals was included in the analysis. Findings: Instead of idealized leadership styles signifying variations in practice, the differences between types of principals were defined by the degree of principal and teacher leadership. Further, the school and principal context, such as school size, urbanicity, accountability performance, and principal background, predicted the three significantly different principal types: controlling, frequent principal leadership; balkanizing, high degree of leadership shared with teachers; or integrating, frequent principal leadership as well as a high degree of leadership shared with teachers. Conclusions: These types suggest that principals simultaneously practice leadership behaviors associated with multiple leadership styles in accordance with their background and school context.

Information and Communication Technology (ICT) leadership supports effective instructional practices through a combination of interpersonal skills, knowledge of a variety of current technology applications, and the vision to anticipate future technology-based solutions for education. The potential benefits of good ICT leadership can include improved academic achievement by students, improved student attendance and reduced attrition, better vocational preparation of students, more efficient administrative operations, and reduced teacher/staff burnout and turnover. The main objectives of this study are to investigate principals’ ICT leadership practices in their respective colleges and the methods and strategies principals use to lead technology integration into the educational environment. Qualitative as well as quantitative data were collected by means of semi-structured interviews and questionnaires that were administered to teachers and principals of professional colleges. This study reveals that technology integration as an instructional strategy needs to be learned in the wider context of changing pedagogy and paradigms of thought about technology use in education.

Revista Iberoamericana Sobre Calidad, Eficacia y Cambio en Educacion",,,"The purpose of this study was to examine the relative impact of different types of leadership on students’ academic and nonacademic outcomes. The methodology involved an analysis of findings from 27 published studies of the relationship between leadership and student outcomes. The first meta-analysis, including 22 of the 7 studies, involved a comparison of the effects of transformational and instructional leadership on student outcomes. The second meta-analysis involved a comparison of the effects of five inductively derived sets of leadership practices on student outcomes. Twelve of the studies contributed to this second analysis. The first meta-analysis indicated that the average effect of instructional leadership on student outcomes was three to four times that of transformational leadership. Inspection of the survey items used to measure school leadership revealed five sets of leadership practices or dimensions: establishing goals and expectations; resourcing strategically; planning, coordinating, and evaluating teaching and the curriculum; promoting and participating in teacher learning and development, and ensuring an orderly and supportive environment. The second meta-analysis revealed strong average effects for the leadership dimension involving promoting and participating in teacher learning and development and moderate effects for the dimensions concerned with goal setting and planning, coordinating, and evaluating teaching and the curriculum. The comparisons between transformational and instructional leadership and between the five leadership dimensions suggested that the more leaders focus their relationships, their work, and their learning on the core business of teaching and learning, the greater their influence on student outcomes. The article concludes with a discussion of the need for leadership research and practice to be more closely linked to the evidence on effective teaching and effective teacher learning.

Research Methods: The schools were selected from a geographically stratified sample of public middle schools in a state in the southeastern United States. Multiple linear regression was used to identify schools performing better than expected considering their levels of poverty and other school-related factors. The final three schools, one from each geographic region, showed steady increases in academic achievement and school climate following the arrival of their principals. Data were primarily collected from interviews with principals, teaching and nonteaching staff, and parents using protocols adapted from the International Successful School Principalship Project. Findings: The findings explicate the large degree to which the leadership practices and beliefs that influenced student achievement in these schools were adapted to and commensurate with each school's immediate context. Furthermore, they illustrate how principals used these practices to institutionalize school-wide reform efforts as vehicles for leading change within their schools. Implications: The findings substantiate research on successful school leadership in high-needs middle schools. They also extend this research by examining the way core transformational and instructional leadership practices can be adapted to suit various school contexts and institutionalize school-wide reform efforts to enhance student learning.

Culture Re-Boot reframes school culture to include organizational learning, relational trust, accountability, program improvement, and teacher effectiveness while showing you how to: Be the transformational leader your school needs to reinvigorate your school culture; Establish a student-centered learning culture focused on student outcomes; Engage teachers in culture-focused leadership teams that support teacher and student learning; Get parents and community on-board to collaborate for student achievement; Connect professional development and school culture for maximum results Packed with hands-on culture re-boot activities to help school leaders and faculty revitalize their school's values and practices, this practical handbook for school improvement will energize your school's culture and build the capacity to help all students succeed. “Ever since Seymour Sarason wrote his seminal book on The Culture of Schools and the Problem of Change, we have known that ‘culture’ is at the heart of all organizational performance. But reformers keep forgetting this key fact. Kaplan and Owings’ book changes all that. Now in one place you can find everything you need to know to ‘re-boot’ you own school's culture.” —Michael Fullan, Author of Motion Leadership “As a principal focused on student achievement and school climate, I am excited to begin using these strategies and discussions to drive our conversations to a deeper and more meaningful level. The combination of school culture, professional learning community, and teacher/community leadership provides a compelling and unique exploration of real methods to sustain student achievement and school improvement.” —William Richard Hall, Jr., Principal R.

The purpose of this paper is to contribute to the current literature by empirically testing the relationships between the principal leadership and the teacher self-efficacy, a construct which has a proven impact on student achievement. The role of collective efficacy on the relationship between transformational leadership of principals and self-efficacy of teachers was a special focus for the study. Design/methodology/approach: A causal comparative research design was employed to study the direct, indirect, and mediating relationships among principal leadership, teacher self-efficacy, and collective efficacy in schools. The participants included a cluster-random sample of 813 primary school teachers. Data gathering instruments composed of a combination of the Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire, the Collective Teacher Efficacy Scale and the Teacher's Sense of Efficacy Scale. A structural equation modelling with path analysis was employed to test the research models and hypotheses. Findings: Findings of the study demonstrated that collective efficacy and transformation leadership jointly shape teachers' self-efficacy. There was a significant relationship between principals' transformational leadership and teachers' self-efficacy beliefs. This relationship was mediated and magnified by collective efficacy in schools. Research limitations/implications: The study has the common limitations of the self-reported perceptions of participants. Originality/value: The study enlightened the little-known causal relationship mechanisms through which transformational leadership practices of principals and collective efficacy of schools affect the self-efficacy beliefs of teachers. The findings are in line with the socio-cognitive theory which assumes the presence of reciprocal relationships among leadership, organization, and person domains in shaping organizational behaviors of teachers. The study also parallels with the emerging literature about the mediating effects of collective efficacy on the relationship between principal transformational leadership and teacher self-efficacy. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited. © 2011 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."

The objectives of this article are to (a) better understand how teachers' collective decision making and principal's leadership are related to the schools' culture homogeneity and (b) test the moderating role of the schools' culture homogeneity on the relationship between four cultural scales and the schools' mathematics achievement. Method: The sample of this study consisted of 2,595 students nested in 52 schools and 125 classes from the French-speaking community of Belgium. Students performed two mathematics achievement tests and answered a self-reported questionnaire on their backgrounds. All the teachers (n = 817) of the 52 schools answered a self-reported questionnaire dealing with the principal's leadership, school culture, and teacher collegiality. Hypotheses are tested using correlation, regression, and hierarchical regression analyses. Research Findings: First, it was found that culture homogeneity is positively associated with (a) the principal's transformational leadership (TL) and (b) the teachers' collective decision making relative to pedagogical aspects. Second, it was shown that the impact of TL on culture homogeneity is partially mediated by teachers' collective decision making. Third, the analyses found no moderation effect of culture homogeneity on the relationship between cultural values and students' achievement but did show partial evidence of such an effect in specific groups of schools (with low or high socioeconomic status composition). Implications: This study provides a deeper understanding of how social arrangements and leadership processes within schools contribute to the emergence of collective cultural values.

Research Design: The methodology involved an analysis of findings from 27 published studies of the relationship between leadership and student outcomes. The first meta-analysis, including 22 of the 27 studies, involved a comparison of the effects of transformational and instructional leadership on student outcomes. The second meta-analysis involved a comparison of the effects of five inductively derived sets of leadership practices on student outcomes. Twelve of the studies contributed to this second analysis. Findings: The first meta-analysis indicated that the average effect of instructional leadership on student outcomes was three to four times that of transformational leadership. Inspection of the survey items used to measure school leadership revealed five sets of leadership practices or dimensions: establishing goals and expectations; resourcing strategically; planning, coordinating, and evaluating teaching and the curriculum; promoting and participating in teacher learning and development, and ensuring an orderly and supportive environment. The second meta-analysis revealed strong average effects for the leadership dimension involving promoting and participating in teacher learning and development and moderate effects for the dimensions concerned with goal setting and planning, coordinating, and evaluating teaching and the curriculum. Conclusions and Implications for Research and Practice: The comparisons between transformational and instructional leadership and between the five leadership dimensions suggested that the more leaders focus their relationships, their work, and their learning on the core business of teaching and learning, the greater their influence on student outcomes. The article concludes with a discussion of the need for leadership research and practice to be more closely linked to the evidence on effective teaching and effective teacher learning.

Principal transformational leadership was not associated directly with either school staff turnover or school-aggregated student achievement progress. Rather, principal transformational leadership showed an indirect effect, through staff job satisfaction, on school staff turnover (negative) and on school-aggregated student achievement progress (positive). Finally, higher levels of school staff job satisfaction were associated with smaller achievement gaps between minority and non-minority students.

SSPs in this study mostly tend to display paternalistic leadership attitudes and behaviors in terms of dedication and self-sacrifice, serving, intrinsic motivation, and influencing stakeholders. They exhibit almost all the attitudes and behaviors of servant leadership, act according to some national and moral values, and experience national attitudes such as patriotism and nationalism intensely.

The instructional leadership model refers to the role and the functions of school leadership to employ different management tasks with regards to teaching and learning. Instructional leadership role includes (a) developing mission and goals, (b) managing the educational production function, (c) promoting an academic learning climate, and (d) developing a supportive work environment. Instructional leaders were described as leading from a combination of both expertise and charisma focused primarily on the improvement of student learning outcomes. The monograph, entitled Instructional Leadership and Effective Teaching and Learning and written by Nazmi Xhomara, is dedicated to school instructional leadership as an important factor that influences teaching and learning at school. In the first chapter, the author presents and analyzes educational leadership vs educational management, as well as models of educational leadership and management. The author argues on the importance of different leadership models, such as managerial leadership, transformational leadership, participative leadership, interpersonal leadership, transactional leadership, postmodern leadership, moral leadership, and contingent leadership. Chapters Two, Three, and Four shed light on instructional leadership and teaching and learning, understanding of instructional leadership, the concept and practice of instructional leadership, instructional school leadership and learning environment, attributes of instructional leaders, instructional excellence, instructional leadership time management, effective teaching and teachers, as well as teaching challenges and learning environment. Meanwhile, the author has analyzed constructivism, student intelligence, understanding of supervision, instructional collegial supervision, supervision approaches, understanding of evaluation of teaching and learning, teacher evaluation, and instructional observing instruments in chapters Five, Six, and Seven. Chapters Eight and Nine are focused especially on the research work of the relationships between instructional leadership and teaching, learning, and students' achievements, as well as on an empirical study designed and conducted in Albania as a case. Chapters Ten and Eleven are dedicated to instructional leadership preparation and the future of instructional leadership. As a conclusion, Xhomara indicates that principals are responsible for developing school climates and cultures that support the very best instructional practices. The new era of instructional leadership has predictably placed significant demands for accountability for student success and equity on the principal as well as for the university programs that prepare them. Working in twenty-first-century schools, the instructional leader is held more accountable than ever for student success. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."
data_rawScopus_2025-08-23_PrincipalsTL_AcademicAchievement_16.ris,ris,Connection between Taiwanese research on school leadership and global scholarship: A bibliometric review,"Pan, H.-L.W.; Chen, W.-Y.",2021,Journal of Research in Education Sciences,10.6209/jories.202106_66(2).0006,,"1. Background Systematic reviews may inform public policies and contribute to the building of a knowledge base. However, reviews of school leadership research are relatively rare in Taiwan. This study conducted a bibliometric review to analyze journal papers by Taiwanese scholars in the Scopus database published in the previous 20 years. The focus was to examine the connection between Taiwanese and global research on school leadership. 2. Research questions On the basis of the research background, four research questions were proposed: (1) What is the volume and growth trajectory of Taiwanese school leadership research?(2) What is the international visibility of Taiwanese school leadership research as revealed through citation analysis? (3) What are the main topics covered by Taiwanese school leadership research and how do they correspond to the global trend? (4) What is the intellectual structure of Taiwanese school leadership research and how do it connect with the global literature? 3. Theoretical framework (1) Intellectual development of school leadership research The theory movement in the 1950s and 1960s highlighted the development of educational administration research. Griffiths (1959) categorized these theories into four groups: social system and role theory, leadership theory, decision theory, and organizational theory. In the 1970s,contingency theory, which emphasizes the influence of context on leadership, was proposed. With the growing interest in school effectiveness and school reform, the organizational perspective was applied to investigate school leadership. Instructional leadership was also emphasized from then on. In the 1990s, other leadership approaches such as transformational leadership, moral leadership, and distributed leadership became popular in school leadership research. With the power paradigm shifting from a heroic view of leaders to a more dispersed view of power, distributed leadership and teacher leadership were also highly recognized. In response to the international context, leadership for learning, which includes elements of instructional leadership, transformational leadership, and shared leadership, has gained global attention in the new millennium. (2) Retrospective view of school leadership research Systematic reviews did not appear in the field of educational administration until the 1980s. EPPI-Centre (2012) indicated the four key features of systematic reviews. First, a high quality systematic review is explicit and is conducted using transparent methods. Second, it follows a standard set of stages. Third, the review is accountable, replicable, and updateable. Fourth, users should be involved to ensure reports are relevant and useful. The elements of reviews include the central topics of interest, guiding questions, and goals; a conceptual perspective for guiding there view’s selection, evaluation, and interpretation of the studies; sources and types of data; data evaluation and analysis; and the major results of the review (Hallinger, 2014). However, according to Hallinger’s study in 2014, only eight reviews met these criteria. Of the eight studies, some used critical synthesis, some adopted meta-analysis, and some employed both. In recent years, network analysis, data mining, and bibliometric analysis are increasingly being applied in systematic reviews. In addition to a greater diversity in methods, the regions under review have expanded from the United States and United Kingdom to many other regions. This development can be attributed to Hallinger’s effort to initiate international collaboration to build the knowledge base of educational leadership in Asia. Because of the growing interest in the academic development in non-Western countries, he promoted the use of systematic reviews to examine studies in Asia, Africa, Saudi Arabia, and Central and South America, which resulted in more than 30 systematic reviews on educational leadership and management. A wide range of research topics is a prominent feature of educational leadership and management research. Five topics that have gained frequent attention are social justice, female leadership, school leadership preparation and development, trust, and instruction and instructional leadership. The following are the topics of frontier research in this field: principal, school leadership, and student achievement; distributed leadership, instructional leadership, teacher learning, accountability, school improvement, school reform, and leadership development; and race, justice, and urban education. In Taiwan, research reviews on educational leadership are scant. According to Lin’s (2000) review, only a few studies have focused on the impact of principals on students. Pan’s (2010) review indicated that of all the educational leadership studies in government-funded projects and journals,70% of the topics were related to principals’ leadership styles and behaviors. The distribution of the research topics was not sufficiently diversified to reflect global academic development. 4. Research method This study used bibliometric analysis on the Scopus database to analyze Taiwanese school leadership research. The review process was based on the steps of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) developed by Moher et al. (2009). After the process of screening, identification, eligibility determination, and inclusion, 95 papers were included for analysis. Descriptive analysis, citation analysis, co-occurrence analysis of keywords, and co-citation analysis were conducted to address the research questions. 5. Research findings The study had the following three key findings: (1) Concerning the volume of publication in journals, the first English paper on Taiwanese school leadership research did not appear until 2001.Although the promotion of the world university rankings and the launch of the Top University Project have changed the trend of solely using Chinese for academic writing, the number of English studies on school leadership remains limited. Moreover, only 14.7% of papers are published in the core journals of education leadership and management. (2) A citation analysis revealed that the international visibility of Taiwanese school leadership research is low. The average number of papers of the 10 most cited Taiwanese scholars is 3.5, and they have been cited an average of 45.2times. The number of citations of Taiwanese scholars is 3.33 times less than that of African educational leadership research and 11.78 times less than that of research on three emerging regions. (3) The research topics selected by Taiwanese scholars may highlight international academic development; however, some underdeveloped topics remain such as social justice leadership, organizational theory, institutional theory, and social capital. The current co-citation analysis revealed the four schools of thought of Taiwanese school leadership, namely leadership for learning, distributed forms of leadership, leadership behavior and its impact, and social network. 6. Contributions Systematic reviews on school leadership are scarce in Taiwan. The present study conducted a 206 bibliometric analysis to examine the development and features of Taiwanese school leadership literature which is innovative in the research method. The connection between Taiwanese studies on school leadership research and global scholarship has seldom been addressed in relevant research. The current analysis presents the development of Taiwanese school leadership and its connection with global trends, providing critical insights and directions for future research on school leadership in Taiwan. 7. Implications The present findings indicate the future direction of Taiwanese academic development in the field of educational administration. First, publishing more research in English can help increase the international impact of Taiwanese scholars. Greater exposure in English publications can highlight the fruitful outcome of Taiwanese school leadership research internationally. Building the academic connections between Taiwan and other countries will also be beneficial. Second, the current study identified a gap between Taiwanese school leadership research and the global trend. Including more diversified topics may help broaden the scope of research. Some topics recommended for future study include social justice leadership, organizational theory, institutional theory, social capital theory, social justice theory, and critical racialism. Third, conducting periodic replication studies using bibliometric analysis may help track the development of Taiwanese school leadership research. In particular, this method allows for a comparison of the distinguishing features of research among different periods. Fourth, a bibliometric analysis on Taiwanese school leadership research published in Chinese would be of considerable value. Taiwan has several literature databases that collect domestic research. However, the data structure provides insufficient information for an effective bibliometric analysis. To maximize the usefulness of these databases, their data structure design merits special consideration. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."

The study sought to establish the relationship between idealized influence of principals’ transformational leadership style and students’ academic performance in KCSE in Bomet County in Kenya. The descriptive survey design was used for this study whose target population comprised of 130 secondary schools and five Quality Assurance and Standards Officers in Bomet County. Stratified random sampling procedure was adopted to sample out schools as boys’, girls’ and mixed schools; then Slovin’s formula was used to obtain a total of 108 schools. While purposive sampling procedure was applied to choose one Director of Studies from each 108 schools selected and five Quality Assurance and Standards Officers from the five sub-counties in Bomet County. A total sample of 118 respondents from 108 secondary schools and the five sub-counties participated in the study. When collecting the data, instruments used were Director of Studies’ questionnaires, Quality Assurance and Standards Officers’ interview guides, school and Bomet County Director of Education KCSE records. Chi-square test was adopted to establish the relationship between principals’ idealized influence and academic performance and the results showed that principals’ idealized influence had a strong significant relationship with students’ academic performance in KCSE. Thus, idealized influence characteristics are most effective in promoting students’ academic achievement. The study recommends that the idealized influence should be adopted and displayed by principals in order to improve academic performance in KCSE examinations. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."

This has cultivated both policy and research interest in understanding how principals' leadership behaviors can leverage student outcomes both directly and indirectly through teachers. In this quest, three leadership models have become prominent due to their close relation to classroom instruction and learning: instructional, transformational, and distributed leadership. The current study aims to reveal the relationships between these leadership behaviors of principals and student outcomes as well as assess the mediating effect of teacher self-efficacy on this relationship. Utilizing meta-analytic structural equation modelling (MASEM) methodology, the study analyzes data from prior studies to offer a more comprehensive and holistic analysis of the complex relationships between the variables. The analysis of data from 90 studies showed that all three leadership behaviors affected student outcomes both directly and indirectly through teacher self-efficacy. They also had a moderate direct influence on teacher self-efficacy, while teacher self-efficacy had a moderate effect on student outcomes. These results reiterate the significance of principals' leadership for learning to facilitate student outcomes and suggest that the integrated practice of leadership in accordance with contextual requirements could leverage the effectiveness and improvement of schools. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."

Hence, the current study extended the knowledge by examining the impact of IL and TL on implementing the School Improvement Programme (SIP) in the Ethiopian context designed to foster students’ academic performance. This study randomly sampled and surveyed 2880 public secondary school teachers and 70 principals. The study’s findings suggested that school principals’ personal information, gender, academic qualification, and leadership experience determine their leadership style, the coherence of SIP, and school performance. Unlike previous evidence, this study’s findings shed light on the principals’ IL and TL practice, which significantly impacted students’ academic achievement through the mediating role of coherent SIP. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."

Utilizing a systematic grounded theory method (SGTM), we conducted research in the provinces of Amasya, Çorum, Samsun, and Tokat in Türkiye. Purposeful and theoretical sampling methods were employed to recruit successful school principals, deputy principals, teachers, students, and parents from secondary schools affiliated with the Ministry of National Education (MoNE). The data draws on unstructured individual and focus group interviews, as well as documents and observations. All the data obtained were inductively analyzed through open, axis, and selective coding stages. Based on the codes, sub-categories, categories, themes, and dimensions from the analyses, we designed the Contextual Successful School Principalship Model (CSSPM), which falls into four dimensions as follows: individual, managerial, organizational, and instructional. SSPs in this study mostly tend to display paternalistic leadership attitudes and behaviors in terms of dedication and self-sacrifice, serving, intrinsic motivation, and influencing stakeholders. They exhibit almost all the attitudes and behaviors of servant leadership, act according to some national and moral values, and experience national attitudes such as patriotism and nationalism intensely. By giving importance to the academic socialization of students' mothers, successful school principals exhibit transformational and instructional leadership behaviors. They act strategically to directly involve mothers in enhancing student achievement, demonstrating their commitment to fostering an inclusive and supportive educational environment. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."

This current study was initiated due to the prevalence of low student achievement as well as the observed controversies regarding effective types of leadership behaviors in secondary schools in the Gedeo Zone of Ethiopia. The aim of the study was to examine the effect of secondary school principals’ leadership behaviors on student outcomes in the zone and consequently to identify effective types of leadership constructs that could enhance learners’ success. An explanatory sequential mixed-design approach was used with a sample of six schools which were chosen by using a maximum variation strategy. Out of these six sampled schools, eighteen (18) participants, comprising of six (6) principals, four (4) district supervisors, two (2) zone education experts and six (6) PTSA chairmen were chosen for the qualitative phase. These participants were selected purposively as they have a better understanding, by virtue of their position regarding the effect of principals’ leadership behavior on student achievement.

In this research, we examined the relationship between integrated leadership and teacher professional learning and teacher practices in Turkey, where educational policy makers have recently introduced several school reform initiatives. More specifically, we aimed to examine the moderating function of transformational leadership in the relationship between instructional leadership and teacher practices, with an emphasis on the mediating role of teacher professional learning. Research Design: We conducted this study with a cross-sectional design and moderated mediation model. Data collected from 616 teachers working in a mix of primary and secondary schools in Turkey were analyzed using structural equation modeling and bootstrapping tests. Findings: We found evidence that transformational leadership acted as a moderator of the indirect effect of principal instructional leadership on teachers' instructional practices through teacher professional learning. Implications: This study adds to the accumulated body of knowledge on the effects of school leadership by concluding that the effect of instructional leadership on teacher learning and practice is contingent upon the extent to which principals enact transformational leadership. School principals who adopt a more comprehensive leadership approach that combines instructional leadership and transformational leadership practices can maximize their effects on student achievement through teacher learning, and better address the ever-growing demands of educational reforms. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."
data_rawScopus_2025-08-23_PrincipalsTL_StudentAchievement_42.ris,ris,Instructional leadership and effective teaching and learning,"Xhomara, N.",2021,,10.52305/pvle5825,,"School leadership has been identified as a key function in assuring quality in education. The instructional leadership model refers to the role and the functions of school leadership to employ different management tasks with regards to teaching and learning. Instructional leadership role includes (a) developing mission and goals, (b) managing the educational production function, (c) promoting an academic learning climate, and (d) developing a supportive work environment. Instructional leaders were described as leading from a combination of both expertise and charisma focused primarily on the improvement of student learning outcomes. The monograph, entitled Instructional Leadership and Effective Teaching and Learning and written by Nazmi Xhomara, is dedicated to school instructional leadership as an important factor that influences teaching and learning at school. In the first chapter, the author presents and analyzes educational leadership vs educational management, as well as models of educational leadership and management. The author argues on the importance of different leadership models, such as managerial leadership, transformational leadership, participative leadership, interpersonal leadership, transactional leadership, postmodern leadership, moral leadership, and contingent leadership. Chapters Two, Three, and Four shed light on instructional leadership and teaching and learning, understanding of instructional leadership, the concept and practice of instructional leadership, instructional school leadership and learning environment, attributes of instructional leaders, instructional excellence, instructional leadership time management, effective teaching and teachers, as well as teaching challenges and learning environment. Meanwhile, the author has analyzed constructivism, student intelligence, understanding of supervision, instructional collegial supervision, supervision approaches, understanding of evaluation of teaching and learning, teacher evaluation, and instructional observing instruments in chapters Five, Six, and Seven. Chapters Eight and Nine are focused especially on the research work of the relationships between instructional leadership and teaching, learning, and students' achievements, as well as on an empirical study designed and conducted in Albania as a case. Chapters Ten and Eleven are dedicated to instructional leadership preparation and the future of instructional leadership. As a conclusion, Xhomara indicates that principals are responsible for developing school climates and cultures that support the very best instructional practices. The new era of instructional leadership has predictably placed significant demands for accountability for student success and equity on the principal as well as for the university programs that prepare them. Working in twenty-first-century schools, the instructional leader is held more accountable than ever for student success. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."

Background Systematic reviews may inform public policies and contribute to the building of a knowledge base. However, reviews of school leadership research are relatively rare in Taiwan. This study conducted a bibliometric review to analyze journal papers by Taiwanese scholars in the Scopus database published in the previous 20 years. The focus was to examine the connection between Taiwanese and global research on school leadership. 2. Research questions On the basis of the research background, four research questions were proposed: (1) What is the volume and growth trajectory of Taiwanese school leadership research?(2) What is the international visibility of Taiwanese school leadership research as revealed through citation analysis? (3) What are the main topics covered by Taiwanese school leadership research and how do they correspond to the global trend? (4) What is the intellectual structure of Taiwanese school leadership research and how do it connect with the global literature? 3. Theoretical framework (1) Intellectual development of school leadership research The theory movement in the 1950s and 1960s highlighted the development of educational administration research. Griffiths (1959) categorized these theories into four groups: social system and role theory, leadership theory, decision theory, and organizational theory. In the 1970s,contingency theory, which emphasizes the influence of context on leadership, was proposed. With the growing interest in school effectiveness and school reform, the organizational perspective was applied to investigate school leadership. Instructional leadership was also emphasized from then on. In the 1990s, other leadership approaches such as transformational leadership, moral leadership, and distributed leadership became popular in school leadership research. With the power paradigm shifting from a heroic view of leaders to a more dispersed view of power, distributed leadership and teacher leadership were also highly recognized. In response to the international context, leadership for learning, which includes elements of instructional leadership, transformational leadership, and shared leadership, has gained global attention in the new millennium. (2) Retrospective view of school leadership research Systematic reviews did not appear in the field of educational administration until the 1980s. EPPI-Centre (2012) indicated the four key features of systematic reviews. First, a high quality systematic review is explicit and is conducted using transparent methods. Second, it follows a standard set of stages. Third, the review is accountable, replicable, and updateable. Fourth, users should be involved to ensure reports are relevant and useful. The elements of reviews include the central topics of interest, guiding questions, and goals; a conceptual perspective for guiding there view’s selection, evaluation, and interpretation of the studies; sources and types of data; data evaluation and analysis; and the major results of the review (Hallinger, 2014). However, according to Hallinger’s study in 2014, only eight reviews met these criteria. Of the eight studies, some used critical synthesis, some adopted meta-analysis, and some employed both. In recent years, network analysis, data mining, and bibliometric analysis are increasingly being applied in systematic reviews. In addition to a greater diversity in methods, the regions under review have expanded from the United States and United Kingdom to many other regions. This development can be attributed to Hallinger’s effort to initiate international collaboration to build the knowledge base of educational leadership in Asia. Because of the growing interest in the academic development in non-Western countries, he promoted the use of systematic reviews to examine studies in Asia, Africa, Saudi Arabia, and Central and South America, which resulted in more than 30 systematic reviews on educational leadership and management. A wide range of research topics is a prominent feature of educational leadership and management research. Five topics that have gained frequent attention are social justice, female leadership, school leadership preparation and development, trust, and instruction and instructional leadership. The following are the topics of frontier research in this field: principal, school leadership, and student achievement; distributed leadership, instructional leadership, teacher learning, accountability, school improvement, school reform, and leadership development; and race, justice, and urban education. In Taiwan, research reviews on educational leadership are scant. According to Lin’s (2000) review, only a few studies have focused on the impact of principals on students. Pan’s (2010) review indicated that of all the educational leadership studies in government-funded projects and journals,70% of the topics were related to principals’ leadership styles and behaviors. The distribution of the research topics was not sufficiently diversified to reflect global academic development. 4. Research method This study used bibliometric analysis on the Scopus database to analyze Taiwanese school leadership research. The review process was based on the steps of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) developed by Moher et al. (2009). After the process of screening, identification, eligibility determination, and inclusion, 95 papers were included for analysis. Descriptive analysis, citation analysis, co-occurrence analysis of keywords, and co-citation analysis were conducted to address the research questions. 5. Research findings The study had the following three key findings: (1) Concerning the volume of publication in journals, the first English paper on Taiwanese school leadership research did not appear until 2001.Although the promotion of the world university rankings and the launch of the Top University Project have changed the trend of solely using Chinese for academic writing, the number of English studies on school leadership remains limited. Moreover, only 14.7% of papers are published in the core journals of education leadership and management. (2) A citation analysis revealed that the international visibility of Taiwanese school leadership research is low. The average number of papers of the 10 most cited Taiwanese scholars is 3.5, and they have been cited an average of 45.2times. The number of citations of Taiwanese scholars is 3.33 times less than that of African educational leadership research and 11.78 times less than that of research on three emerging regions. (3) The research topics selected by Taiwanese scholars may highlight international academic development; however, some underdeveloped topics remain such as social justice leadership, organizational theory, institutional theory, and social capital. The current co-citation analysis revealed the four schools of thought of Taiwanese school leadership, namely leadership for learning, distributed forms of leadership, leadership behavior and its impact, and social network. 6. Contributions Systematic reviews on school leadership are scarce in Taiwan. The present study conducted a 206 bibliometric analysis to examine the development and features of Taiwanese school leadership literature which is innovative in the research method. The connection between Taiwanese studies on school leadership research and global scholarship has seldom been addressed in relevant research. The current analysis presents the development of Taiwanese school leadership and its connection with global trends, providing critical insights and directions for future research on school leadership in Taiwan. 7. Implications The present findings indicate the future direction of Taiwanese academic development in the field of educational administration. First, publishing more research in English can help increase the international impact of Taiwanese scholars. Greater exposure in English publications can highlight the fruitful outcome of Taiwanese school leadership research internationally. Building the academic connections between Taiwan and other countries will also be beneficial. Second, the current study identified a gap between Taiwanese school leadership research and the global trend. Including more diversified topics may help broaden the scope of research. Some topics recommended for future study include social justice leadership, organizational theory, institutional theory, social capital theory, social justice theory, and critical racialism. Third, conducting periodic replication studies using bibliometric analysis may help track the development of Taiwanese school leadership research. In particular, this method allows for a comparison of the distinguishing features of research among different periods. Fourth, a bibliometric analysis on Taiwanese school leadership research published in Chinese would be of considerable value. Taiwan has several literature databases that collect domestic research. However, the data structure provides insufficient information for an effective bibliometric analysis. To maximize the usefulness of these databases, their data structure design merits special consideration. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."

This study is a qualitative study with an interactive analysis model on transformational leadership strategies at the international Madrasah Aliyah Amanatul Ummah Mojokerto and the Serpong Insan Cendekia State Madrasah Aliyah. This study concluded that the first strategy to increase the influence of the idealism of the madrasah principal towards an international pesantren-based Madrasah Aliyah is the strong commitment between the principal and teachers, employees, students, as well as parents, beginning with planning (RKM) using school review, quality assurance, benchmarking, and quality control accompanied by exemplary values, an effort to maintain mutual trust as well as the sincerity of all stakeholders. Then, the second strategy is to foster inspirational motivation for the principals of international pesantren-based Madrasah Aliyah which is reflected in the ability of madrasah principals who can motivate and inspire their subordinates to improve the quality of education together. For example, the achievement of madrasah principals, teachers and students winning the international olympiad between 2010-2020 is supported by the principle of Islamic boarding school that is ‘The Islamic Role Model is The First Key to Build Great Leaders’. Furthermore, The third strategy is to strengthen the intellectual stimulus of Madrasah Aliyah’s principal with superior international standards based on Islamic boarding school values, which is reflected in several positive changes made and achieved by the madrasah’s principal, both the quality of the input, process, and output, such as student achievements in national and international levels such as scholarships to the Middle East, Europe, Japan, and Australia. Finally, the last strategy is to transform the madrasah principal’s individualized considereation towards superior international pesantren-based Madrasah Aliyah which is reflected in the ability of madrasah principals in managing human resources appropriately, including managing the right competencies for human resources through the competency development programs for teachers and employees continuously; and improving abilities through training supported by the principles of responsibility and exemplary, which are the characteristics of pesantren. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."

A total of 199 teachers, who taught O-NET and PISA key subjects-45 teachers in English, 77 teachers in science, 77 teachers in math-from the five regions of Thailand representing small, medium, and large school size were recruited through a stratified sampling technique and were asked to rate their principal's transformational school leadership and own transformational classroom leadership. A Thai version of the transformational leadership questionnaire was developed, which consisted of a self-rating and a rater form. Partial Least Square Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) was employed to find the causal relationship, and ANOVA version SPSS 21 was used to compare the SLA among three different school sizes. The study found that transformational school leadership had direct effects on transformational classroom leadership, but transformational classroom leadership did not have a direct effect on English, science, and math teaching. The study also found that large schools had better students' learning achievement compared to small and medium-sized schools, and small-sized schools had the lowest average score in English, science, and math.

The investigator conducted a mixed method study using a survey questionnaire (to include research developed questions and questions from the Belief on Discipline Survey) and an open-ended question. The study examined principals and assistant principals who lead in secondary schools in northern Florida and assessed differences in the implementation of discipline policies between high poverty low-achieving (HPLA) and high poverty high-achieving (HPHA) schools and the impact on student achievement. The study also examined the factors these principals and assistant principals perceived as facilitating and hindering discipline policy. Descriptive statistics were used to examine demographic data. The study used a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) to assess differences in the perceived impact of school discipline policies on student achievement between principals and assistant principals (APs) at HPHA schools and HPLA schools. Qualitative data were analyzed using the constant comparative method. The results of this study suggest there were significant differences in the characteristics of principals and APs serving high poverty (HP) schools, differences in how principals and APs in HP schools perceive their discipline practices in relationship to student success.

The descriptive survey design was used for this study whose target population comprised of 130 secondary schools and five Quality Assurance and Standards Officers in Bomet County. Stratified random sampling procedure was adopted to sample out schools as boys’, girls’ and mixed schools; then Slovin’s formula was used to obtain a total of 108 schools. While purposive sampling procedure was applied to choose one Director of Studies from each 108 schools selected and five Quality Assurance and Standards Officers from the five sub-counties in Bomet County. A total sample of 118 respondents from 108 secondary schools and the five sub-counties participated in the study. When collecting the data, instruments used were Director of Studies’ questionnaires, Quality Assurance and Standards Officers’ interview guides, school and Bomet County Director of Education KCSE records. Chi-square test was adopted to establish the relationship between principals’ idealized influence and academic performance and the results showed that principals’ idealized influence had a strong significant relationship with students’ academic performance in KCSE.

The study sought to measure leadership dimensions based on microdata from contextual questionnaires answered by principals and teachers; propose a model that relates leadership dimensions to student achievement as reflected by schools’ IDEB results; and verify the relationships between leadership dimensions and student achievement. To that end, we performed multivariate analyzes, specifically structural equations modeling, on a database containing microdata from Prova Brasil and IDEB values. Results show that it is possible to measure leadership dimensions using these microdata. Based on the conceptual model developed, there is evidence that the relationships developed by the principal within the school have a greater effect on teachers’ commitment to improve teaching and learning, thus indirectly affecting school performance. In addition, school principals have sought to exercise transformational leadership combined with pedagogical leadership, which represents a challenge for them, since it covers many knowledge areas. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."

Design/methodology/approach – Guided by strong evidence from theories on school leadership and work psychology, the authors hypothesized relations among dimensions of principals’ instructional and transformational leadership behaviors, teachers’ perception of the school climate (social and affective, and physical environment), their job satisfaction and student achievement. The benefits of the principal’s leadership behaviors for student achievement are primarily hypothesized as indirect, with either a weak or statistically non-significant direct positive effect on student outcomes. Path modeling was applied to validate a mediated-effects model using cross-sectional survey data (306 principals, 1,539 teachers) obtained from 306 secondary schools in the two Indian metropolitan cities of New Delhi and Kolkata. Findings – Principal leadership behaviors were not associated directly with either teacher job satisfaction or school-aggregated student achievement. Rather, the transformational leader behavior showed an indirect effect, through the social and affective component of the school climate, on teacher job satisfaction. The physical climate, however, appeared to play a dominating role in mediating the instructional leadership effects on teacher job satisfaction. Comparing the relative indirect effect sizes of the instructional and transformational leadership behaviors on student achievement, principals appear to favor the former approach. Originality/value – This study provides further empirical evidence that instructional leadership better captures the impact of school leadership on student outcomes, when compared to its transformational counterpart. By identifying the relative effects of different leadership practices, school leaders and educational practitioners can focus more on altering the distribution and frequency of those practices that work best for ameliorating student achievement levels. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."

The purpose of this paper is to test a model of integrated transformational leadership including three important school mediators. Design/methodology/approach – In total, 5,392 students provided data on student engagement, and 569 teachers provided survey data on principal leadership and the collective teacher efficacy (CTE) and extra effort of their colleagues. Data were analyzed at the school level (n=51) using mediation analysis with the PROCESS macro to calculate the direct and indirect effects of all of the variables in the serial multiple mediator model. Findings – The model explained a significant amount of variance in both reading (38 percent) and mathematics (35 percent). CTE and student engagement mediated all of the leadership effects, demonstrating the importance of teacher and student relations in school improvement. The combined effect sizes are significantly greater than the effects of earlier TL models. Originality/value – This study contributes to “leadership for learning” research by demonstrating that refining transformational leadership behaviors to include instructional management can enhance a leader’s impact on achievement. As one of the few studies to examine student engagement as a mediator along with teacher mediators, the current study highlights the importance of teacher-student relations in school improvement. While collective efficacy mediated all of the effects of leadership on achievement, student emotional engagement also contributed to mathematics achievement. The study’s findings advance research into mutual influence processes, indicating that reciprocity may extend throughout the leader-teacher-student loop. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."

Research Methods: Empirical data were drawn from a 3-year mixed-methods national study (“Impact Study”) that investigated associations between the work of principals in effective and improving primary and secondary schools in England and student outcomes as defined (but not confined) by their national examination and assessment results over 3 years. The research began with a critical survey of the extant literature, followed by a national survey that explored principals’ and key staff’s perceptions of school improvement strategies and actions that they believed had helped foster better student attainment. This was complemented by multiperspective in-depth case studies of a subsample of 20 schools. Findings: The research provides new empirical evidence of how successful principals directly and indirectly achieve and sustain improvement over time through combining both transformational and instructional leadership strategies. The findings show that schools’ abilities to improve and sustain effectiveness over the long term are not primarily the result of the principals’ leadership style but of their understanding and diagnosis of the school’s needs and their application of clearly articulated, organizationally shared educational values through multiple combinations and accumulations of time and context-sensitive strategies that are “layered” and progressively embedded in the school’s work, culture, and achievements. Implications: Mixed-methods research designs are likely to provide finer grained, more nuanced evidence-based understandings of the leadership roles and behaviors of principals who achieve and sustain educational outcomes in schools than single lens quantitative analyses, meta-analyses, or purely qualitative approaches. The findings themselves provide support for more differentiated, context sensitive training and development for aspiring and serving principals. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."

A Latent Class Analysis of Principal Perception of Leadership,"Urick, A.; Bowers, A.J.",2014,Educational Administration Quarterly,10.1177/0013161x13489019,,"Purpose: Effective styles of principal leadership can help address multiple issues in struggling schools, such as low student achievement and high rates of teacher attrition. Although the literature has nominated certain ""idealized"" leadership styles as being more or less effective, such as transformational, instructional, and shared instructional leadership, we have little evidence about how principals may or may not choose to practice these styles across U.S. schools. Research Design: Latent class analysis was used to identify different types of principals across the United States. We analyzed the 1999-2000 Schools and Staffing Survey as it presents a unique opportunity to study the different types of U.S. principals since it contains leadership measures not found in other national surveys. A final sample of 7,650 public schools and principals was included in the analysis. Findings: Instead of idealized leadership styles signifying variations in practice, the differences between types of principals were defined by the degree of principal and teacher leadership. Further, the school and principal context, such as school size, urbanicity, accountability performance, and principal background, predicted the three significantly different principal types: controlling, frequent principal leadership; balkanizing, high degree of leadership shared with teachers; or integrating, frequent principal leadership as well as a high degree of leadership shared with teachers. Conclusions: These types suggest that principals simultaneously practice leadership behaviors associated with multiple leadership styles in accordance with their background and school context.

Revista Iberoamericana Sobre Calidad, Eficacia y Cambio en Educacion",,,"The purpose of this study was to examine the relative impact of different types of leadership on students’ academic and nonacademic outcomes. The methodology involved an analysis of findings from 27 published studies of the relationship between leadership and student outcomes. The first meta-analysis, including 22 of the 7 studies, involved a comparison of the effects of transformational and instructional leadership on student outcomes. The second meta-analysis involved a comparison of the effects of five inductively derived sets of leadership practices on student outcomes. Twelve of the studies contributed to this second analysis. The first meta-analysis indicated that the average effect of instructional leadership on student outcomes was three to four times that of transformational leadership. Inspection of the survey items used to measure school leadership revealed five sets of leadership practices or dimensions: establishing goals and expectations; resourcing strategically; planning, coordinating, and evaluating teaching and the curriculum; promoting and participating in teacher learning and development, and ensuring an orderly and supportive environment. The second meta-analysis revealed strong average effects for the leadership dimension involving promoting and participating in teacher learning and development and moderate effects for the dimensions concerned with goal setting and planning, coordinating, and evaluating teaching and the curriculum. The comparisons between transformational and instructional leadership and between the five leadership dimensions suggested that the more leaders focus their relationships, their work, and their learning on the core business of teaching and learning, the greater their influence on student outcomes.

Research Methods: The schools were selected from a geographically stratified sample of public middle schools in a state in the southeastern United States. Multiple linear regression was used to identify schools performing better than expected considering their levels of poverty and other school-related factors. The final three schools, one from each geographic region, showed steady increases in academic achievement and school climate following the arrival of their principals. Data were primarily collected from interviews with principals, teaching and nonteaching staff, and parents using protocols adapted from the International Successful School Principalship Project. Findings: The findings explicate the large degree to which the leadership practices and beliefs that influenced student achievement in these schools were adapted to and commensurate with each school's immediate context. Furthermore, they illustrate how principals used these practices to institutionalize school-wide reform efforts as vehicles for leading change within their schools. Implications: The findings substantiate research on successful school leadership in high-needs middle schools. They also extend this research by examining the way core transformational and instructional leadership practices can be adapted to suit various school contexts and institutionalize school-wide reform efforts to enhance student learning.

Findings: Findings of the study demonstrated that collective efficacy and transformation leadership jointly shape teachers' self-efficacy. There was a significant relationship between principals' transformational leadership and teachers' self-efficacy beliefs. This relationship was mediated and magnified by collective efficacy in schools. Research limitations/implications: The study has the common limitations of the self-reported perceptions of participants. Originality/value: The study enlightened the little-known causal relationship mechanisms through which transformational leadership practices of principals and collective efficacy of schools affect the self-efficacy beliefs of teachers. The findings are in line with the socio-cognitive theory which assumes the presence of reciprocal relationships among leadership, organization, and person domains in shaping organizational behaviors of teachers. The study also parallels with the emerging literature about the mediating effects of collective efficacy on the relationship between principal transformational leadership and teacher self-efficacy. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited. © 2011 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."

The objectives of this article are to (a) better understand how teachers' collective decision making and principal's leadership are related to the schools' culture homogeneity and (b) test the moderating role of the schools' culture homogeneity on the relationship between four cultural scales and the schools' mathematics achievement. Method: The sample of this study consisted of 2,595 students nested in 52 schools and 125 classes from the French-speaking community of Belgium. Students performed two mathematics achievement tests and answered a self-reported questionnaire on their backgrounds. All the teachers (n = 817) of the 52 schools answered a self-reported questionnaire dealing with the principal's leadership, school culture, and teacher collegiality. Hypotheses are tested using correlation, regression, and hierarchical regression analyses. Research Findings: First, it was found that culture homogeneity is positively associated with (a) the principal's transformational leadership (TL) and (b) the teachers' collective decision making relative to pedagogical aspects. Second, it was shown that the impact of TL on culture homogeneity is partially mediated by teachers' collective decision making. Third, the analyses found no moderation effect of culture homogeneity on the relationship between cultural values and students' achievement but did show partial evidence of such an effect in specific groups of schools (with low or high socioeconomic status composition). Implications: This study provides a deeper understanding of how social arrangements and leadership processes within schools contribute to the emergence of collective cultural values. But the results also shed light on the weak associations between cultural values and student achievement, even when considering an appropriate definition and conceptualization of the school culture. © 2009 The University Council for Educational Administration. © 2009 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."

Research Design: The methodology involved an analysis of findings from 27 published studies of the relationship between leadership and student outcomes. The first meta-analysis, including 22 of the 27 studies, involved a comparison of the effects of transformational and instructional leadership on student outcomes. The second meta-analysis involved a comparison of the effects of five inductively derived sets of leadership practices on student outcomes. Twelve of the studies contributed to this second analysis. Findings: The first meta-analysis indicated that the average effect of instructional leadership on student outcomes was three to four times that of transformational leadership. Inspection of the survey items used to measure school leadership revealed five sets of leadership practices or dimensions: establishing goals and expectations; resourcing strategically; planning, coordinating, and evaluating teaching and the curriculum; promoting and participating in teacher learning and development, and ensuring an orderly and supportive environment. The second meta-analysis revealed strong average effects for the leadership dimension involving promoting and participating in teacher learning and development and moderate effects for the dimensions concerned with goal setting and planning, coordinating, and evaluating teaching and the curriculum. Conclusions and Implications for Research and Practice: The comparisons between transformational and instructional leadership and between the five leadership dimensions suggested that the more leaders focus their relationships, their work, and their learning on the core business of teaching and learning, the greater their influence on student outcomes. The article concludes with a discussion of the need for leadership research and practice to be more closely linked to the evidence on effective teaching and effective teacher learning.

Studies conducted elsewhere in the world found that effective school leadership is needed for the success of professional development programmes. The purpose of this paper is to explore principals’ lived experiences with regard to their roles in the implementation of the English Language Proficiency Programme (ELPP). Design/methodology/approach: This paper followed a qualitative inquiry with multiple case study designs to explore principals’ lived experiences during the implementation of the ELPP. Ten schools were selected for the analysis, two from each of the five regions. The schools were selected on the basis of remoteness, the total number of teachers who participated in the ELPP, school phases (i.e. primary and combined) and pre-test scores. Principals were interviewed using exploratory open-ended questions, and data analysis produced five categories under which the results were presented. Findings: The findings indicate that principals applied their individual logic to accommodate and implement the programme. They applied their individual productive leadership habitus to contextualise ELPP activities to ease their workload and appear corporative. Principals had significant influence on teacher learning and ensured successful implementation of a ministerial programme. Moreover, their leadership skills influenced the ways in which teachers received instruction and created a conducive learning environment. Owing to principals’ administrative, instructional and transformational leadership, many teachers participated and transcended upward and some were declared proficient in English. Research limitations/implications: This study research the effectiveness of leadership regarding English professional development programmes in achieving goals, explore power relations between school principals and education officials when developing and implementing professional development programmes and establish more efficient ways of providing a better leadership model for professional development programmes to achieve goals. Practical implications: This paper was limited to a few principals at rural schools in selected regions, therefore findings could not be generalised. Social implications: There is a need for creating opportunities for interactions among all stakeholders who are involved in the development and implementation of English proficiency programmes and to build power relations and work as a team to benefit schools. In order to enhance programme implementation and improve learning outcomes, there is also a need to provide feedback at intervals and find solutions to challenges as a team. Originality/value: Placing principals in situations without orientation triggered the need for specific leadership logic and particularities to be applied in a context for the success of the programme, which resulted in participation of more teachers in the ELPP. They applied their particularities and productive habitus through administrative, instructional and transformational leadership to enhance learning. Principals appointed English language teachers to instruct and mentor others, and consequently enabled some principals and teachers to exit the programme. Principals achieved these short wins upon realising that one has to cooperate with the authority to ensure achieving desired outcomes. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."

A qualitative research framework was adopted, which entailed the utilization of purposive sampling technique, semi-structured interviews, and thematic analysis to collect and analyze data. The findings suggest that in the selected institutions, principals have a direct influence on teacher motivation through the provision of supportive governance. In addition, school leadership indirectly shapes teacher performance through lobbying for equitable pay for their subordinates and ensuring access to teaching resources, which in turn influence teacher motivation levels.

To collect the data, Bass and Avolio's Transformational Leadership and principal's psychological empowerment of Spreitzer were used. Analysis of survey data was done by calculating frequencies, percentages, means, standard deviations, correlation coefficient test and stepwise regression coefficient test. The results showed that among a series of seven transformational leadership factors except for leadership that is based on non-interference which is used at an average level, the principals use other factors including: inspirational motivation, idealized influence, intellectual stimulation, contingent reward, personal considerations and management by exception at a high level, respectively. In the case of psychological empowerment variable, the mean scores of principals at all dimensions were placed in the range of high. In this regard, the dimensions of meaning and concept, ability, job satisfaction, the selection and effect obtained the highest mean, respectively. The results also showed that there was a relatively significant positive relationship between idealized influence and inspirational motivation factors of transformational leadership and all aspects of psychological empowerment. In general, there was a significant relationship between the two variables (r = 0.382). Regression test showed that the two factors of inspirational motivation and idealized influence together could predict 23.4% of changes in the psychological empowerment of principals. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."

Recognizing the critical need for specialized programs to support gifted students, this research employs a quasi-experimental design to evaluate the effectiveness of the Integrated Curriculum Model (ICM). Participants included sixth-grade students from two groups: an experimental group receiving the ICM intervention and a control group following the standard curriculum. We collected data using structured questionnaires and analyzed the results using mean, standard deviation, and t-tests to determine statistically significant differences between the groups. Findings revealed that the experimental group showed significantly higher improvements in both verbal-linguistic intelligence and leadership skills compared to the control group, with a significance level of.05. These results underscore the importance of tailored educational strategies in unlocking the full potential of gifted students. The study’s theoretical implications highlight the applicability of Gardner’s Theory of Multiple Intelligences and Burns’ Transformational Leadership Theory in educational settings.

The instructional leadership model refers to the role and the functions of school leadership to employ different management tasks with regards to teaching and learning. Instructional leadership role includes (a) developing mission and goals, (b) managing the educational production function, (c) promoting an academic learning climate, and (d) developing a supportive work environment. Instructional leaders were described as leading from a combination of both expertise and charisma focused primarily on the improvement of student learning outcomes. The monograph, entitled Instructional Leadership and Effective Teaching and Learning and written by Nazmi Xhomara, is dedicated to school instructional leadership as an important factor that influences teaching and learning at school. In the first chapter, the author presents and analyzes educational leadership vs educational management, as well as models of educational leadership and management. The author argues on the importance of different leadership models, such as managerial leadership, transformational leadership, participative leadership, interpersonal leadership, transactional leadership, postmodern leadership, moral leadership, and contingent leadership. Chapters Two, Three, and Four shed light on instructional leadership and teaching and learning, understanding of instructional leadership, the concept and practice of instructional leadership, instructional school leadership and learning environment, attributes of instructional leaders, instructional excellence, instructional leadership time management, effective teaching and teachers, as well as teaching challenges and learning environment. Meanwhile, the author has analyzed constructivism, student intelligence, understanding of supervision, instructional collegial supervision, supervision approaches, understanding of evaluation of teaching and learning, teacher evaluation, and instructional observing instruments in chapters Five, Six, and Seven. Chapters Eight and Nine are focused especially on the research work of the relationships between instructional leadership and teaching, learning, and students' achievements, as well as on an empirical study designed and conducted in Albania as a case. Chapters Ten and Eleven are dedicated to instructional leadership preparation and the future of instructional leadership. As a conclusion, Xhomara indicates that principals are responsible for developing school climates and cultures that support the very best instructional practices. The new era of instructional leadership has predictably placed significant demands for accountability for student success and equity on the principal as well as for the university programs that prepare them. Working in twenty-first-century schools, the instructional leader is held more accountable than ever for student success. © 2021 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc. All rights reserved."

Many schools around the globe are suffering from a shortage of experienced and competent school leaders that can bring about positive change and increase student achievement. Thus, the objective of this study was to determine the correlation between leadership practices, school culture, and student achievement in an effort to build the capacity of principal leaders. A correlational design was used to determine the relationship between principal leadership practices, culture, and achievement in elementary, middle, and high schools. A total of 216 teachers in 31 schools completed the Leadership Practices Inventory and School Culture Survey. A significant correlation was found between (a) leadership practices and school culture and (b) school culture and student achievement. No relationship was established between leadership practices and school culture. The results implied that school leaders who use transformational leadership practices indirectly impact student achievement through creating a positive school culture. It is recommended that principal preparation programs revamp leadership curriculum to develop leaders who can create positive school cultures and manage reform efforts. © The Turkish Online Journal of Educational Technology."

This paper begins by examining the merit of teaching evaluations with reference to the factors influencing the accuracy of the teaching evaluation process. One of the central assumptions on which student evaluation of teaching is based is that there is a relationship between student achievement and student rating of teachers. However, the findings of the majority of studies do not support this assumption. The absence of a strong link between student achievement and teaching evaluations suggests that there is scope for examining other approaches to measuring effective classroom dynamics. This paper presents such an approach based on the notion of transformational classroom leadership. © 2008 Taylor & Francis."

This chapter synthesizes information from various studies of principal instructional leadership since its inception in the 1980s, its subjection to the various changes that happen in schools during the accountability era and school-based management period, as well as the rising and waning of various theories, to show how it is influenced leading to its evolution into 'leadership for learning' which is also known as 'leading learning'. The original model of instructional leadership is initially described and how the subsequent transformational leadership, distributed leadership, and teacher leadership are incorporated into the original instructional leadership theory to produce an integrated leadership for learning were also elaborated. This chapter re-visits the belief and importance placed on school leadership in addition to its crucial role in students' academic achievement and school improvement.

Hence, the current study extended the knowledge by examining the impact of IL and TL on implementing the School Improvement Programme (SIP) in the Ethiopian context designed to foster students’ academic performance. This study randomly sampled and surveyed 2880 public secondary school teachers and 70 principals. The study’s findings suggested that school principals’ personal information, gender, academic qualification, and leadership experience determine their leadership style, the coherence of SIP, and school performance.

Design A large survey based on questionnaires developed from non-school organizations was used to develop a model to test the nature and strength of the relationships between variables and to understand the interactive nature of leadership and organizational learning and their effects on student outcomes. Model testing employed a latent variables partial least squares path analysis procedure. Findings The results of research have shown that leadership characteristics of a school are important factors in promoting systems and structures that enable the school to be effective and improve, in brief, to operate as a learning organization. School leaders need to be skilled in transformational leadership practices which work, directly and indirectly through others, towards bringing about: consensus in the organization’s mission; structures for shared decision making; continual learning through reflective practice; high standards of professionalism; and, a supportive and appreciative climate that promotes a culture of trust and collaboration. The LOLSO research also demonstrates that schools can be identified as learning organizations as they establish sequentially systems and structures of operation that promote: a collaborative and trusting work environment; a shared and monitored mission; empowerment of its members to share decision-making, show initiative and take risks; and, on-going challenging and relevant professional development. These school factors of leadership and organizational learning are shown to influence what happens in the core business of the school; the teaching and learning. Value The article answers two fundamental questions: Does the nature of the leadership and the level of organizational learning in schools contribute to school effectiveness and improvement in terms of the extent of students’ participation in school, student academic self-concept and engagement with school? What is the nature of the relationship between non-academic student measures of participation in school, student self-concept and engagement with school and measures of student retention and academic achievement?. © 2010 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Background Systematic reviews may inform public policies and contribute to the building of a knowledge base. However, reviews of school leadership research are relatively rare in Taiwan. This study conducted a bibliometric review to analyze journal papers by Taiwanese scholars in the Scopus database published in the previous 20 years. The focus was to examine the connection between Taiwanese and global research on school leadership. 2. Research questions On the basis of the research background, four research questions were proposed: (1) What is the volume and growth trajectory of Taiwanese school leadership research?(2) What is the international visibility of Taiwanese school leadership research as revealed through citation analysis? (3) What are the main topics covered by Taiwanese school leadership research and how do they correspond to the global trend? (4) What is the intellectual structure of Taiwanese school leadership research and how do it connect with the global literature? 3. Theoretical framework (1) Intellectual development of school leadership research The theory movement in the 1950s and 1960s highlighted the development of educational administration research. Griffiths (1959) categorized these theories into four groups: social system and role theory, leadership theory, decision theory, and organizational theory. In the 1970s,contingency theory, which emphasizes the influence of context on leadership, was proposed. With the growing interest in school effectiveness and school reform, the organizational perspective was applied to investigate school leadership. Instructional leadership was also emphasized from then on. In the 1990s, other leadership approaches such as transformational leadership, moral leadership, and distributed leadership became popular in school leadership research. With the power paradigm shifting from a heroic view of leaders to a more dispersed view of power, distributed leadership and teacher leadership were also highly recognized. In response to the international context, leadership for learning, which includes elements of instructional leadership, transformational leadership, and shared leadership, has gained global attention in the new millennium. (2) Retrospective view of school leadership research Systematic reviews did not appear in the field of educational administration until the 1980s. EPPI-Centre (2012) indicated the four key features of systematic reviews. First, a high quality systematic review is explicit and is conducted using transparent methods. Second, it follows a standard set of stages. Third, the review is accountable, replicable, and updateable. Fourth, users should be involved to ensure reports are relevant and useful. The elements of reviews include the central topics of interest, guiding questions, and goals; a conceptual perspective for guiding there view’s selection, evaluation, and interpretation of the studies; sources and types of data; data evaluation and analysis; and the major results of the review (Hallinger, 2014). However, according to Hallinger’s study in 2014, only eight reviews met these criteria. Of the eight studies, some used critical synthesis, some adopted meta-analysis, and some employed both. In recent years, network analysis, data mining, and bibliometric analysis are increasingly being applied in systematic reviews. In addition to a greater diversity in methods, the regions under review have expanded from the United States and United Kingdom to many other regions. This development can be attributed to Hallinger’s effort to initiate international collaboration to build the knowledge base of educational leadership in Asia. Because of the growing interest in the academic development in non-Western countries, he promoted the use of systematic reviews to examine studies in Asia, Africa, Saudi Arabia, and Central and South America, which resulted in more than 30 systematic reviews on educational leadership and management. A wide range of research topics is a prominent feature of educational leadership and management research. Five topics that have gained frequent attention are social justice, female leadership, school leadership preparation and development, trust, and instruction and instructional leadership. The following are the topics of frontier research in this field: principal, school leadership, and student achievement; distributed leadership, instructional leadership, teacher learning, accountability, school improvement, school reform, and leadership development; and race, justice, and urban education. In Taiwan, research reviews on educational leadership are scant. According to Lin’s (2000) review, only a few studies have focused on the impact of principals on students. Pan’s (2010) review indicated that of all the educational leadership studies in government-funded projects and journals,70% of the topics were related to principals’ leadership styles and behaviors. The distribution of the research topics was not sufficiently diversified to reflect global academic development. 4. Research method This study used bibliometric analysis on the Scopus database to analyze Taiwanese school leadership research. The review process was based on the steps of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) developed by Moher et al. (2009). After the process of screening, identification, eligibility determination, and inclusion, 95 papers were included for analysis. Descriptive analysis, citation analysis, co-occurrence analysis of keywords, and co-citation analysis were conducted to address the research questions. 5. Research findings The study had the following three key findings: (1) Concerning the volume of publication in journals, the first English paper on Taiwanese school leadership research did not appear until 2001.Although the promotion of the world university rankings and the launch of the Top University Project have changed the trend of solely using Chinese for academic writing, the number of English studies on school leadership remains limited. Moreover, only 14.7% of papers are published in the core journals of education leadership and management. (2) A citation analysis revealed that the international visibility of Taiwanese school leadership research is low. The average number of papers of the 10 most cited Taiwanese scholars is 3.5, and they have been cited an average of 45.2times. The number of citations of Taiwanese scholars is 3.33 times less than that of African educational leadership research and 11.78 times less than that of research on three emerging regions. (3) The research topics selected by Taiwanese scholars may highlight international academic development; however, some underdeveloped topics remain such as social justice leadership, organizational theory, institutional theory, and social capital. The current co-citation analysis revealed the four schools of thought of Taiwanese school leadership, namely leadership for learning, distributed forms of leadership, leadership behavior and its impact, and social network. 6. Contributions Systematic reviews on school leadership are scarce in Taiwan. The present study conducted a 206 bibliometric analysis to examine the development and features of Taiwanese school leadership literature which is innovative in the research method. The connection between Taiwanese studies on school leadership research and global scholarship has seldom been addressed in relevant research. The current analysis presents the development of Taiwanese school leadership and its connection with global trends, providing critical insights and directions for future research on school leadership in Taiwan. 7. Implications The present findings indicate the future direction of Taiwanese academic development in the field of educational administration. First, publishing more research in English can help increase the international impact of Taiwanese scholars. Greater exposure in English publications can highlight the fruitful outcome of Taiwanese school leadership research internationally. Building the academic connections between Taiwan and other countries will also be beneficial. Second, the current study identified a gap between Taiwanese school leadership research and the global trend. Including more diversified topics may help broaden the scope of research. Some topics recommended for future study include social justice leadership, organizational theory, institutional theory, social capital theory, social justice theory, and critical racialism. Third, conducting periodic replication studies using bibliometric analysis may help track the development of Taiwanese school leadership research. In particular, this method allows for a comparison of the distinguishing features of research among different periods. Fourth, a bibliometric analysis on Taiwanese school leadership research published in Chinese would be of considerable value. Taiwan has several literature databases that collect domestic research. However, the data structure provides insufficient information for an effective bibliometric analysis. To maximize the usefulness of these databases, their data structure design merits special consideration. © 2021, National Taiwan Normal University. All rights reserved."

The purpose of this paper is to investigate the servitization strategies of manufacturing firms, more specifically about: (i) how manufacturing companies move toward servitization (servitization pattern); (ii) how they achieve the capabilities needed; and (iii) which factors enable this transition. We did so by comparing the state of the art of academic research with a qualified sample of case studies of global companies that famously improved their competitiveness by shifting from products to solutions. The results show some gaps between research and practice, concerning in particular: the impact (either transformational or integrative) of servitization on the manufacturing organization; the role of financial resources in shaping the capability achievement strategy, particularly for external acquisitions, and; the role of servitization enablers poorly considered by the extant literature, such as time, leadership and continuity, operational excellence and digital technologies.

Information and Communication Technology (ICT) leadership supports effective instructional practices through a combination of interpersonal skills, knowledge of a variety of current technology applications, and the vision to anticipate future technology-based solutions for education. The potential benefits of good ICT leadership can include improved academic achievement by students, improved student attendance and reduced attrition, better vocational preparation of students, more efficient administrative operations, and reduced teacher/staff burnout and turnover. The main objectives of this study are to investigate principals’ ICT leadership practices in their respective colleges and the methods and strategies principals use to lead technology integration into the educational environment. Qualitative as well as quantitative data were collected by means of semi-structured interviews and questionnaires that were administered to teachers and principals of professional colleges. This study reveals that technology integration as an instructional strategy needs to be learned in the wider context of changing pedagogy and paradigms of thought about technology use in education. Principals who effectively lead ICT integration within their colleges classically perform well in leadership and management, vision and goal setting, student learning, teaching, professional development and training, operations and infrastructure support, and assessment and evaluation. © Springer India 2014."

Revista Iberoamericana Sobre Calidad, Eficacia y Cambio en Educacion",,,"The purpose of this study was to examine the relative impact of different types of leadership on students’ academic and nonacademic outcomes. The methodology involved an analysis of findings from 27 published studies of the relationship between leadership and student outcomes. The first meta-analysis, including 22 of the 7 studies, involved a comparison of the effects of transformational and instructional leadership on student outcomes. The second meta-analysis involved a comparison of the effects of five inductively derived sets of leadership practices on student outcomes. Twelve of the studies contributed to this second analysis. The first meta-analysis indicated that the average effect of instructional leadership on student outcomes was three to four times that of transformational leadership. Inspection of the survey items used to measure school leadership revealed five sets of leadership practices or dimensions: establishing goals and expectations; resourcing strategically; planning, coordinating, and evaluating teaching and the curriculum; promoting and participating in teacher learning and development, and ensuring an orderly and supportive environment. The second meta-analysis revealed strong average effects for the leadership dimension involving promoting and participating in teacher learning and development and moderate effects for the dimensions concerned with goal setting and planning, coordinating, and evaluating teaching and the curriculum. The comparisons between transformational and instructional leadership and between the five leadership dimensions suggested that the more leaders focus their relationships, their work, and their learning on the core business of teaching and learning, the greater their influence on student outcomes. The article concludes with a discussion of the need for leadership research and practice to be more closely linked to the evidence on effective teaching and effective teacher learning. Such alignment could increase the impact of school leadership on student outcomes even further. © 2014 Universidad Autonoma de Madrid. All rights reserved."

Referring to the full range leadership theory (FRLT), we examined the effects of transformational and passive leadership styles of university instructors on students' satisfaction and learning outcomes. Completed web-based questionnaires were obtained from 1270 students who enrolled in large academic courses led by instructors in web-based instructional environments. Data analyses confirmed the validity of the multifactor leadership questionnaire (MLQ) in the virtual asynchronous communication setting with three second-order factors model composed of transformational, active management-by-exception and passive leadership. Leadership styles correlated with student satisfaction: the more the students attributed transformational leadership style to the instructor and the less they attributed a passive leadership style, the more satisfied they were. The attributed leadership style was not related to the actual participation of the students in the virtual discussions or to their academic achievements. The findings suggest that subordinates' satisfaction might be tied more strongly to their perception of the leader than to the actual tangible benefits the leader can provide. Moreover, the study shows that the FRLT is applied to the asynchronous, web-based, instructional environment which is being increasingly adopted in higher education institutions. © The Author(s) 2013."

This current study was initiated due to the prevalence of low student achievement as well as the observed controversies regarding effective types of leadership behaviors in secondary schools in the Gedeo Zone of Ethiopia. The aim of the study was to examine the effect of secondary school principals’ leadership behaviors on student outcomes in the zone and consequently to identify effective types of leadership constructs that could enhance learners’ success. An explanatory sequential mixed-design approach was used with a sample of six schools which were chosen by using a maximum variation strategy. Out of these six sampled schools, eighteen (18) participants, comprising of six (6) principals, four (4) district supervisors, two (2) zone education experts and six (6) PTSA chairmen were chosen for the qualitative phase. These participants were selected purposively as they have a better understanding, by virtue of their position regarding the effect of principals’ leadership behavior on student achievement. A close-ended questionnaire was used to collect quantitative data, while interviews and document analysis were used as research instruments in the qualitative phase.

Design/methodology/approach - The paper outlines the characteristics of four main leadership styles - transformational, authoritarian, participative and delegative - and describes the benefits the college has gained by, in the main, practicing transformational leadership. Findings - The paper shows that, when transformational leadership is practiced, team members believe that their leaders care about them as people, rather than as a means to an end; leaders pay close attention to team members' need for achievement and personal growth, creating an environment in which team members feel that they are pursuing meaningful goals; and leaders gain credibility and respect by ""walking the talk"". Practical implications - The paper provides useful information on the advantages and disadvantages of various leadership styles, when practiced in an academic environment. Originality/value - The paper reveals that other leadership styles also have their part to play.

Research Methods: The schools were selected from a geographically stratified sample of public middle schools in a state in the southeastern United States. Multiple linear regression was used to identify schools performing better than expected considering their levels of poverty and other school-related factors. The final three schools, one from each geographic region, showed steady increases in academic achievement and school climate following the arrival of their principals. Data were primarily collected from interviews with principals, teaching and nonteaching staff, and parents using protocols adapted from the International Successful School Principalship Project. Findings: The findings explicate the large degree to which the leadership practices and beliefs that influenced student achievement in these schools were adapted to and commensurate with each school's immediate context. Furthermore, they illustrate how principals used these practices to institutionalize school-wide reform efforts as vehicles for leading change within their schools. Implications: The findings substantiate research on successful school leadership in high-needs middle schools. They also extend this research by examining the way core transformational and instructional leadership practices can be adapted to suit various school contexts and institutionalize school-wide reform efforts to enhance student learning. Further research is required to understand how principals decide to adapt their leadership practices, and how aspiring leaders can best learn to do so. © The University Council for Educational Administration 2013."

Successful leadership is ensured by school leaders’ compliance to a set of basic practices within particular school contexts. The impact of leadership styles on performance, the work environment and job satisfaction is emphasized, while the appropriate leadership style could make teachers more effective in terms of job productivity. The adoption of different leadership styles by school leaders shows positive results with regard to school effectiveness. The purpose of this paper is to describe school leadership styles and the influence the styles have on school performance. Design/methodology/approach: A quantitative approach with a post-positive paradigm was followed. A systematic random sample of 72 secondary schools in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, was selected. The Cronbach’s α coefficient, statistical significance (p-values) and effect size (d-values) were calculated, and a factor analysis was conducted. Findings: The results show a difference between teachers and principals regarding the transformational leadership style. The principals in the high-performing schools were perceived as less passive-avoidant in practice than those in the low-performing schools. A principal manages and leads a school effectively by applying an appropriate leadership style. Research limitations/implications: For future research, it will be advisable to make use of a mixed-method design. Although the Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire addressed numerous aspects of leadership and leadership styles, the “voice” of the respondents lacked. Furthermore, more leadership styles could be investigated in different contexts. Practical implications: A chosen principal leadership style is not necessarily the best style for this purpose. School principals and teachers interpret leadership styles differently. Communication is therefore important. Social implications: The principal leadership style is not always necessarily the teachers’ and learners’ choice. It is important that schools keep up with a constantly changing world. Originality/value: If school principals and teachers agree upon a specific leadership style, there may be better collaboration which enhances better academic performance as well as effectiveness regarding schools. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited."

However, we currently face major challenges to maintain and promote people's health. Although these complicated problems pose numerous threats to public welfare, education of public health for health professionals still retains 20th-century standards. This also means that graduate education of public health in Japan is traditionally based on obtaining licensure as a medical professional, conducting research and writing papers, and on-the-job training. Since graduate school education is expected to produce competent public health leaders, Japan requires a reform toward a new education design that caters to the current societal needs. The current global trend in the education of health professionals leans toward outcome-based education to meet core competencies. Here, ""competency"" refers to a set of features or particular behavioral patterns possessed by highly qualified persons. In 2006, the World Health Organization (WHO) established a general health professional competency standard that includes both management and leadership competencies. Moreover, the Lancet Commission concluded that there was a need for transformative education based on a ""health system approach."" In brief, this means that our education should correspond to the needs of the health system to allow for the resolution of problems by educated professionals with satisfactory levels of competencies. In addition, as ""change agents,"" these competent professionals are expected to promote societal change toward the realization of better public health. In Japan, the Central Education Council has produced several reports on professional graduate school reform since 2000. These reports indicate that graduate school curricula require reform to allow the health professionals to work locally and globally, as well as to solve problems through the application of systematic knowledge that matches practice with theory. Therefore, with reference to the current Japanese health situation, global trends in education, and the Japanese educational policies, transformational changes are needed toward a new era of Japanese public health education specifically through outcome-based education to improve the health professionals competencies. We hope that education in the new schools of public health will contribute to solve authentic public health problems and create a healthy future with competent professionals."

However, existing research mainly focuses on qualitative discussions at the institutional level, and fewer studies are in-depth empirical investigations. Using field survey data of rural areas in Shaanxi Province of China in 2011, an in-depth empirical investigation of the relationship between village cadre competency and rural development, as well as the moderating effect of the village cadre social capital in this relationship, were explored in this study. Results show that three dimensions of village cadre competency (i.e. achievement motivation, individual influence and administrative leadership capabilities) are positively correlated with rural development. Achievement motivation of village cadres can stimulate individual behaviors, and individual influence and administrative leadership capabilities can benefit the establishment of a confidence mechanism and promote social innovation. Furthermore, the social capital of village cadres strengthens the positive relationship between village cadre competency and rural development. When village cadres possess richer network resources in social capital, their competency can easily promote rural development through mobilization of the social structure. The results obtained in this study reveal the relationships between village cadre competency, social capital, and rural development, which also support the discussion of social transformational development in rural areas at the micro-level to a certain extent. © 2016, Editura Lumen.

Our research reveals a nuanced relationship between varied leadership styles, institutional cultures, and the drive for innovation. Notably, transformational leadership aligns strongly with innovative outcomes and a collaborative institutional ethos, in contrast to the more rigid structures associated with authoritarian and laissez-faire leadership styles. The philosophical core of this inquiry lies in examining how leadership practices embody and promote ethical values that influence collective and individual success. Institutions that cultivate a culture of collaboration and are open to embracing risk are found to be more conducive to innovation. In contrast, settings that emphasize rigid hierarchies and prioritize individual achievement tend to stifle creative and innovative practices. Our findings emphasize the crucial role of leaders in shaping an ethical climate that nurtures innovation. Effective leadership is pivotal in fostering an environment supportive of progressive teaching and management strategies. This includes investing in faculty development, enhancing collaborative efforts, and acknowledging academic excellence. Moreover, the strategic integration of technology and a shift towards student-centred learning are identified as essential for advancing innovative teaching practices. By delving into the philosophical and ethical dimensions of educational leadership, this study contributes to a deeper understanding of how leadership rooted in ethical and collaborative values can profoundly impact educational innovation and success. The insights gained underscore the potential for educational leaders to drive significant change by adhering to philosophically and ethically sound practices. © (2024), (European Journal for Philosophy of Religion).

Further, role of leader member exchange (LMX) and the association period in between TL and RI as well as SWL shall also be examined. So, the present paper attempts to evaluate the moderated-mediated effect of TL on RI and SWL. Design/methodology/approach – The model has been tested in the higher education sector. Information regarding TL, LMX, SWL and RI has been procured from teachers. The data have been duly validated with the help of confirmatory factor analysis. Reliability has been assessed through Cronbach’s α and composite reliability. Structural equation modelling has been used for testing the hypotheses. Moderation has been checked through multi-group analysis. Findings – The results indicate that association period moderates the TL and LMX relationship. LMX mediates the TL and RI and SWL relationship. Finally, moderated- mediated impact of TL on RI and SWL have been found. Managerial, practical, social, economic implications and scope for future research have also been discussed. Research limitations/implications – This study represents a cross-sectional investigations as responses were gathered from respondents at a particular point of time. Moreover, the study is confined to government degree colleges operating in Jammu district only. In future longitudinal study can be conducted. Comparative study between private and public colleges can be undertaken in future. Practical implications – Leaders should focus on creating positive environment, where personal work goals of the subordinates are linked with organisational goals, with the help of role-person integration. Leaders should make their decisions more transparent by exhibiting consistency in their logic and reasoning. Remaining impartial in decision making will help leaders to instil trust and respect in the minds of subordinates. Trust among the followers can be increased through commitments and achievement of goals. Leaders should create more enthusiasm and optimism amongst the employees. Social implications – Leaders in education institutes should create social and emotional learning environment in the colleges. This can be done by arranging informal meetings, some kinds of fares, painting competitions and festive celebrations at collaborative level. This strategic action will help to provide an opportunity to all employees’ to come forward in an informal friendly environment, which will help to reduce stress, anxiety, and depression; and improve the quality of relationship and ultimately enhance satisfaction among followers’ with respect to their leaders. The followers work for the achievement of departmental as well as the organisational goals in collaboration with their leaders. Originality/value – The paper has evaluated the moderation of association period between TL and LMX relationship in higher education sector which has not been explored earlier in leadership studies. Many studies have evaluated the direct impact but moderated-mediated impact of TL on RI and SWL has not been evaluated earlier, which will contribute equally to academic as well as business world. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited."

This study conducts a comprehensive evaluation of current literature to examine the effects of several leadership styles, such as transformational, transactional, servant, and authentic leadership, on employee performance and competency. The main goal is to determine the impact of various leadership styles on the efficiency and contentment of employees in academic environments in shaping the values and culture of employees through the organizational strategies they implement. The technique included a Systematic Literature Review (SLR), utilising data from Scopus and Google Scholar, and implementing a meticulous selection process to incorporate pertinent research published from 2020 to 2024. 15 papers were examined, specifically investigating the correlation between leadership styles, employee performance, and competency. The results indicate that transformational leadership has a highly substantial beneficial influence on performance and competency, promoting creativity and employee engagement. Transactional leadership, although successful in ensuring stability and providing incentives for achievement, yields inconsistent outcomes. The servant and authentic leadership styles have a beneficial impact on employee satisfaction and organisational commitment, which in turn leads to enhanced performance. On the other hand, laissez-faire leadership is linked to adverse consequences, such as reduced motivation and productivity. The study asserts that comprehending and embracing the suitable leadership approach is crucial for augmenting employee performance and proficiency in higher education institutions. This research makes a significant addition by delivering a thorough analysis of how different leadership styles impact academic personnel may vary depending on the institutional context and organizational culture.

Design/methodology/approach: This study has analysed 417 publications from the Scopus database on collective leadership from 1967 to 2023. Data were analysed using MS Excel and VOSviewer. Findings: There has been research from different parts of the world on the various aspects of collective leadership. In recent years, collective leadership research has gained momentum. However, collective leadership is still at a nascent level when it comes to the applicability of the concepts. So far, the research on collective leadership has relied on themes such as shared leadership and distributed leadership, how collective leadership differs from other similar-looking leadership styles such as transformational leadership, and how this influences followers’ outcomes such as team effectiveness, achievements, relations, commitment, etc. Most of the research so far has been done in the United States of America, the UK and the Australian context. There exists a huge gap for studying collective leadership in African, Middle Eastern and Asian contexts. Research limitations/implications: Collective leadership research trends may be addressed to enable academics and practitioners to better understand current and future trends and research directions.

Case overview/synopsis: In “Cultural Collisions: The Struggle for Recognition in a Cross-Cultural Workplace,” Alex Brown, the National Marketing Head at ShowVista, faces mounting frustration as his contributions to the company’s success go unrecognized. Despite spearheading innovative marketing strategies that boosted revenue, Brown finds himself sidelined in an organization where hierarchy, consensus-driven decision-making and relationship-based leadership take precedence over individual achievement. ShowVista’s Indian-influenced corporate culture clashes with Brown’s results-oriented, recognition-driven mindset, leaving him isolated and undervalued. His attempts to implement data-driven approaches are met with resistance, while credit for his successes is often attributed to senior executives. The strain of navigating an unfamiliar work culture, compounded by personal sacrifices, forces Brown to question his future at the company. As he stands at a crossroads, he must decide whether to adapt to ShowVista’s norms or seek an organization that aligns with his values. The case examines the complexities of cultural fit, leadership role in a multicultural organization and career identity in a global workplace.

In the most general form, the material is presented regarding the strategic guidelines for the quality of education in the WHE with special learning conditions in the context of Ukraine's integration into the European educational space. Philosophical and methodological approaches to solving existing disagreements in the field of human measurement of the quality of police education in Ukraine and abroad are studied in integral connection with the corresponding concepts of human development; leadership theories; the genesis of personnel work on professional training and evaluation of the activities of police officers in the system of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Ukraine. Features of the human-measurement training of officers of the National Police of Ukraine are explained on the basis of the provisions of the modern post-non-classical methodology of science, a general scientific holistic approach, humanistic pedagogy, as well as the methodological foundations for the implementation of international standards of ethical behavior in the activities of police officers, which is an objective need of the current Ukrainian education system in general and in particular, a prerequisite for the prevention of corruption offenses, the vitality of virtue in society. The productivity of reflexive practices of self-organization of the personality of future police officers is substantiated as a condition for the development of psychological resilience. The book proves the necessity and prospects of research and implementation in the theory and practice of police education of the concept of Ukrainian general scientific methodology regarding the unity of the formation and development of a Human on the basis of the cognitive-emotional-volitional triad of components of the value experience of the individual. Based on the real originality of the formation of the value experience of a police officer in the process of professional training, constructive practice, the general theoretical and methodological origins and meaningful lines of practical improvement and further personal and professional growth of a police officer in their official activities as mechanisms for protecting human rights and freedoms in the activities of law enforcement officers are identified. The novelty of the approaches is associated with the use of the key foundations of psychopedagogical support and the development of pedagogical skills of HEI teachers with special learning conditions, the activities of mentors to harmonize the professional training of the applicant's personality in the system of departmental education, the use of a criteria approach for assessing learning outcomes, the design features of police work programs in the context of the scale of human-dimensional meanings evaluating the quality of higher education The constructiveness of this perspective is distinguished, first of all, by a holistic combination and use as the latest achievements of the psychological, pedagogical, legal, neurophysiological branches of scientific knowledge to explain the newly formed pedagogical phenomena of the modern educational sphere in the aspect of innovativeness of markers for assessing the quality of educational and research activities education; and the understanding that universal human and nation-creating value orientations as a special social basis of the culturological worldview should be extrapolated into the global function of modern education, which should determine and realize its social power that characterizes civilizational development in different historical epochs.

A recent US study indicates that despite being raised in elite neighborhoods, Black males raised in affluent conditions are less likely than White males to maintain their wealth status into adulthood. While strong instruction, adult support, and inclusive cultures have been proven to mitigate a myriad of risk factors for historically marginalized groups of students, opportunity gaps continue to face young people of color, even in affluent suburban districts, where the appearance of a level playing field can lead educators to underestimate their role in building social capital in their students. High graduation rates notwithstanding, school leaders in suburban districts must be prepared to lead staff to understand the critical impact of disparities in preparation on the competitiveness of their students of color and firstgeneration students. They must seek to uncover critical differences in how opportunities are parceled out, address subtle barriers to access, resist the “opportunity hoarding” that works to maintain the status quo in many districts, and develop in staff the pedagogical and relational skills that engage students of color in the highest opportunities available to them. Though many school administrators may be White, middle class, and personally unfamiliar with some of the racial and socioeconomic challenges that face many suburban districts today, their effectiveness in eliminating achievement and opportunity gaps will hinge on their ability to prepare all students for competition on a playing field that remains anything but level. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020."

This paper reviews the impact of transformational leadership in fostering a conducive environment for Education 4.0, emphasising personalised and technology-enhanced learning experiences. With their vision and motivational prowess, transformational leaders are crucial in steering educational institutions through digital transformation, encouraging the adoption of advanced technologies like artificial intelligence, virtual reality, and data analytics. These leaders are pivotal in nurturing a culture of continuous improvement and empowerment, actively involving team members in pursuing collective achievements and personal growth. The study highlights the importance of transformational leadership in addressing the dynamic challenges and opportunities presented by Education 4.0. By inspiring educators and students to embrace change, transformational leaders facilitate the integration of innovative teaching methods and technologies, enhancing learning outcomes and preparing students for the demands of the digital age. The findings suggest that transformational leadership is instrumental in creating a flexible, relevant, and forward-thinking educational environment that aligns with the objectives of Education 4.0.

Because implicit biases that stereotypically masculine behaviors are required for effective leadership remain strong, examining faculty members' perceptions of their chair's leadership in medical school departments with women chairs can provide insight into the views of women leaders in academic medicine and the complex ways in which gender may impact these chairs' leadership style and actions. Methods: We conducted semistructured interviews with 13 male and 15 female faculty members representing all faculty tracks in three clinical departments chaired by women. Inductive, qualitative analysis of the subsequent text allowed themes to emerge across interviews. Results: Four themes emerged regarding departmental leadership. One dealt with the leadership of the previous chair. The other three described the current chair's characteristics (tough, direct, and transparent), her use of communal actions to help support and mentor her faculty, and her ability to build power through consensus. Because all three chairs were early in their tenure, a wait and see attitude was frequently expressed. Faculty generally viewed having a woman chair as an indication of positive change, with potential individual and institutional advantages. Conclusions: This exploratory study suggests that the culture of academic medicine has moved beyond questioning women physicians' competence to lead once they are in top organizational leadership positions. The findings are also consonant with experimental research indicating that women leaders are most successful when they pair stereotypic male (agentic) behaviors with stereotypic female (communal) behaviors. All three chairs exhibited features of a transformational leadership style and characteristics deemed essential for effective leadership in academic medicine. Copyright 2010, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc."

After teachers and teaching, school leadership is the most important determinant of learner achievement in school. Despite this, there is still uncertainty regarding what successful school leadership is and what successful school leaders do in non-Western contexts. In this mixed methods study I explored successful high school leadership in South Africa. Specifically, a questionnaire was administered to 38 principals from academically high-achieving schools from a range of socioeconomic contexts throughout the Western Cape, and 14 principals were interviewed. An integrated analysis reveals the paradox of uniqueness and universality of successful school leadership in South Africa, outlining that while there is no single best approach, various similarities exist between successful school leaders and established international literature. I found that successful principals adapt to their context, amalgamate transformational, instructional and distributed leadership styles, set direction, develop people, constantly realign the school with teaching and learning, and, importantly, strive to make a difference in the lives of others. It is about leading with Ubuntu. By highlighting these characteristics and practices, I offer theoretical, practical and personal advice to current and aspiring school leaders, academics and policy makers. © 2023, South African Journal Of Education.

Informed by constructivist grounded theory (CGT), semi-structured interviews were conducted with 27 graduates (2008–2012) from one postgraduate programme, who were at different stages in their careers worldwide. The audio data were transcribed and analysed using a CGT approach. Participants enrolled in award-bearing medical education courses for various intrinsic and extrinsic reasons. The findings from this study highlight their development as educators, and educational researchers, leaders and learners, as their self-efficacy in educational practices and engagement in scholarly activities increased. Graduates attributed career progression to the qualification, with many being promoted into senior positions. They also described substantial performance attainments in the workplace. The findings contribute to understanding the complexity and nuances of educational identity formation of healthcare professionals.

The main problem and hypothesis of the present research is to argue that the Semiotics of Discourse (Paris School) can provide ʻpart ofʼ a comprehensive theoretical framework for conceptualizing coaching and its development as an academic discipline and subdiscipline. Therefore, adopting a descriptive-analytic method based on Fontanille's ideas (Fontanille, 2003, as translated by Bostic, 2006) in analyzing and solving a case study of one of her clients in coaching, and introducing the term ʻKhodnavardiʼ being established and registered in Iran by her, the author examines this problem and hypothesis. In order to make linguistics (its types and subdisciplines), semiotics (its types, and other fields intertwined with it), and other possible, probable fields, institutions, practitioners, skills, and sciences more practical, the current and future objective of this inquiry is to elementarily introduce the process of coaching discourse as an object and corpus of transdisciplinary studies. This trajectory will finally provide the context for the localization of the academic discipline, subdiscipline, and new profession of coaching, and subsequently coaching education and studies, and coaching training: A kind of localization, entrepreneurship and job creation. Pointing out the similarities between the Semiotics of Discourse (Paris School) and coaching, and presenting a model based on “Khodnavardi”, the main achievement of this inquiry is suggesting the basics of ʻSemiotic Coachingʼ at an academic level in Iran. In addition, ʻSemiotic Coachingʼ can lead to interactions or commonalities with other fields, institutions, practitioners, skills, and sciences including pragmatism, educational linguistics, edusemiotics, change, transformation, cognitive sciences, philosophy, sociology, psychology, teaching, communication, management, human and organizational resource development, leadership, literature, cinema and theater, etc., and on the other hand, with different types of coaching like linguistic, semantic, ontological, integral, existential, narrative, cognitive, clean language, core energy, neuro-linguistic, academic, developmental, emotional intelligence, and other topics which will not be addressed for the sake of brevity. © 2022, Tarbiat Modares University.

Transactional leadership consists of planning, implementation, and evaluation. Transformational leadership consists of charisma, intellectual stimulation, and individualized consideration that can motivate followers. The six orientations that characterize the Catholic healthcare ministry imply both types of leadership. Fundamental values, knowledge, and skills required for healthcare organization management are acquired through health administration education. The themes prevalent in today's Catholic healthcare ministry and the leadership qualities they imply are addressed by all aspects of such education: degree programs, field experience, continuing education, and research and consultation. Much of a master's degree program concentrates on transactional leadership because its content is better formulated and easier to teach. The development of transformational leadership qualities during master's study primarily provides a foundation on which students can build. Health administration programs in cooperation with healthcare organizations have created three models for field experience: internships, residencies, and fellowships. Many master's programs deliver continuing education programs for both types of leadership, and research and consultation contribute to this education."

Furthermore, the study examines the roles of psychological capital, self-regulation, and conscientiousness in the relationship between psychological capital and academic achievement. A questionnaire survey method and convenience sampling were used to collect 719 formal questionnaires. The research results indicate that universities of applied sciences in Hebei Province, China, perceive that a teacher’s transformational leadership has a significant positive impact on students’ academic achievement. Moreover, perceiving a teacher’s transformational leadership has a significant positive impact on students’ psychological capital and self-regulation, both of which have a significant positive impact on academic achievement. Psychological capital and self-regulation mediate the relationship between teachers’ transformational leadership and students’ academic achievement. Furthermore, conscientiousness moderates the relationship between psychological capital and academic achievement. © 2024 Common Ground Research Networks. All rights reserved."

It was developed in the Cooperative University of Colombia, a country where technical and technological programmes have been promoted in the past 10 years through institutions of higher education. We build on the idea that knowing the leadership styles of teachers and principals is fundamental. The main objective of the study is thus to formulate achievement strategies to improve the educative centre and the educational community at several levels: as individuals, as groups and as an organization. To this aim we conducted a descriptive research with a non-experimental design by the poll method, through the implementation of the ‘Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire by Bass and Avolio–MLQ’ instrument, administered to teachers and principals of technical-technological programmes of the Cooperative University of Colombia. Results show that the elements of Transformational Leadership are predominant over the other types of Leadership. They thus emerge as the key element to strengthen, through individual training processes and organizational improvement strategies, in order to achieve optimal organizational results. This must be carried out from within the educational entity, through the motivation of students and work groups, strengthening the practices of teachers and principals in the development of basic organizational and academic functions. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."

Specifically, it examines how WE mediate the relationship between TL and lecturers' career achievements. TL, characterised by its ability to inspire and motivate followers, was discovered to drive positive organisational change and enhance goal attainment. This research highlights how institutional factors such as leadership decision-making, employee collaboration, and communication influence career trajectories and contribute to career achievement levels. Key milestones in lecturers' careers, such as appointments, promotions, tenure, and professional growth in teaching, research, and leadership, were considered. Factors like academic qualifications, research productivity, teaching experience, and scholarly publications were identified as influential. Furthermore, maintaining high WE are crucial for managing workloads and meeting academic responsibilities. Using a sample of 974 lecturers selected through random sampling and data collected via questionnaires, the study applied quantitative analysis to investigate the correlation between TL behaviours, WE, and career achievements. The findings reveal that TL positively affects lecturers' career achievements, with WE serving as a significant mediating factor. This underscores the importance of TL and efficient work practices in advancing lecturers' careers and enhancing organisational effectiveness. © 2024, Creative Publishing House. All rights reserved."

Strengthening the internal governance of the interdisciplinary entrepreneurial team in universities is an important measure to enhance the transformation of scientific and technological achievements in universities and boost the construction of the national innovation system. The interdisciplinary entrepreneurial team in universities is the source of the improvement of academic entrepreneurial performance, there is still a lack of systematic and comprehensive theoretical and empirical research on its internal governance. This paper takes interdisciplinary entrepreneurial teams in universities as the study object, analyzes the internal governance mechanism and laws of interdisciplinary entrepreneurial teams in universities theoretically and empirically, and finds that: Transformational leadership has positive impacts on interdisciplinary collaboration and academic entrepreneurial performance in interdisciplinary entrepreneurial teams in universities; Interdisciplinary collaboration plays a partial mediating effect in the relationship between transformational leadership and academic entrepreneurial performance; The relationship conflict in conflict plays both a negative and a positive moderating effect in the relationship between transformational leadership and the different dimensions of interdisciplinary collaboration. The task conflict in conflict has an insignificant negative moderating effect in the relationship between transformational leadership and the quality of collaboration in interdisciplinary collaboration. The findings of this paper emphasize the matching law of the materialization process of the productivity of interdisciplinary entrepreneurial teams in universities, and also provide evidence for the coupling of core elements in the internal governance process of interdisciplinary entrepreneurial teams in universities. The theoretical contribution of this paper are as follows: firstly, there has been controversy over the dimensions of transformational leadership in previous studies. This paper confirms that transformational leadership is a univariate variable and cannot be divided into different dimensions, indicating that there may be important situational elements in the dimension division of transformational leadership. Secondly, based on the interdisciplinary characteristics of interdisciplinary entrepreneurial teams in universities, this paper explores the integration of transformational leadership and interdisciplinary cooperation, two key governance elements that affect the growth and development of interdisciplinary entrepreneurial teams in universities, into the common research model. This not only expands the analytical framework for the performance of transformational leadership in academic entrepreneurial teams, but also systematically depicts and describes the internal governance mechanisms of interdisciplinary entrepreneurial teams in universities, this goes beyond the existing study framework on the separation of transformational leadership and interdisciplinary cooperation, it is an important supplement to both transformational leadership theory and interdisciplinary cooperation theory. Thirdly, this study finds that there are significant differences in the moderating effects of different dimensions of conflict in the relationship between transformational leadership and interdisciplinary cooperation, which breaks through the stereotype that relationship conflict always has a negative impact in previous studies, and is an important supplement to the conflict theory and the theory of competition and cooperation. The practical inspiration of this paper lies in: the paper focuses on the most important internal governance variable of the team - the key role of transformational leadership in the academic entrepreneurial performance of interdisciplinary entrepreneurial teams in universities. At the same time, this paper emphasizes that interdisciplinary cooperation is an important path to improve the internal governance performance of interdisciplinary entrepreneurial teams in universities. Moreover, the paper identifies the different roles that conflict plays in the process of transformational leadership leading interdisciplinary entrepreneurial team members in universities to engage in interdisciplinary cooperation. © 2024 Editorial Department of Studies in Science of Science.

Research Design: The methodology involved an analysis of findings from 27 published studies of the relationship between leadership and student outcomes. The first meta-analysis, including 22 of the 27 studies, involved a comparison of the effects of transformational and instructional leadership on student outcomes. The second meta-analysis involved a comparison of the effects of five inductively derived sets of leadership practices on student outcomes. Twelve of the studies contributed to this second analysis. Findings: The first meta-analysis indicated that the average effect of instructional leadership on student outcomes was three to four times that of transformational leadership. Inspection of the survey items used to measure school leadership revealed five sets of leadership practices or dimensions: establishing goals and expectations; resourcing strategically; planning, coordinating, and evaluating teaching and the curriculum; promoting and participating in teacher learning and development, and ensuring an orderly and supportive environment. The second meta-analysis revealed strong average effects for the leadership dimension involving promoting and participating in teacher learning and development and moderate effects for the dimensions concerned with goal setting and planning, coordinating, and evaluating teaching and the curriculum. Conclusions and Implications for Research and Practice: The comparisons between transformational and instructional leadership and between the five leadership dimensions suggested that the more leaders focus their relationships, their work, and their learning on the core business of teaching and learning, the greater their influence on student outcomes. The article concludes with a discussion of the need for leadership research and practice to be more closely linked to the evidence on effective teaching and effective teacher learning. Such alignment could increase the impact of school leadership on student outcomes even further. © 2008 The University Council for Educational Administration."

Utilizing a systematic grounded theory method (SGTM), we conducted research in the provinces of Amasya, Çorum, Samsun, and Tokat in Türkiye. Purposeful and theoretical sampling methods were employed to recruit successful school principals, deputy principals, teachers, students, and parents from secondary schools affiliated with the Ministry of National Education (MoNE). The data draws on unstructured individual and focus group interviews, as well as documents and observations. All the data obtained were inductively analyzed through open, axis, and selective coding stages. Based on the codes, sub-categories, categories, themes, and dimensions from the analyses, we designed the Contextual Successful School Principalship Model (CSSPM), which falls into four dimensions as follows: individual, managerial, organizational, and instructional. SSPs in this study mostly tend to display paternalistic leadership attitudes and behaviors in terms of dedication and self-sacrifice, serving, intrinsic motivation, and influencing stakeholders. They exhibit almost all the attitudes and behaviors of servant leadership, act according to some national and moral values, and experience national attitudes such as patriotism and nationalism intensely. By giving importance to the academic socialization of students' mothers, successful school principals exhibit transformational and instructional leadership behaviors. They act strategically to directly involve mothers in enhancing student achievement, demonstrating their commitment to fostering an inclusive and supportive educational environment. © 2024, Ozgen Korkmaz.

Study Design: Cross-sectional national survey. Methods: Executive directors of community health centers (269 respondents; response rate = 40.9%) were surveyed regarding their perceptions of the medical director's leadership, and for quantitative information on the center's achievement of clinical (mostly disease management) goals. The dependent variables were the medical director's scores (as perceived by the executive director) on transformational, transactional, and laissez-faire leadership, effectiveness, satisfaction with the leader, and subordinate extra effort, using an adapted Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire (43 items; 5-point Likert scale). The independent variable was the medical director's management training status. Results: Compared with medical directors with <30 days of in-service training, medical directors with an MHA, MPH, or MBA, or ≥30 days of in-service training, had 0.32, 0.35, 0.30, 0.36, and 0.37 higher scores on transformational leadership, transactional leadership, rated effectiveness, satisfaction, and subordinate extra effort, respectively, and 0.31 lower score on laissez-faire leadership (all P < .001). Medical directors without management degrees but with ≥30 days of in-service training had 0.34, 0.36, 0.50, and 0.47 higher scores on transformational leadership, transactional leadership, rated effectiveness, and satisfaction with the leader (all P < .02). Our data previously had demonstrated that medical directors' transformational leadership significantly influences achievement of disease management goals. Conclusion: Training may enable physician executives to develop leadership styles that are effective in influencing clinical providers' adoption of disease management guidelines under managed care."

In particular, the past twenty years have witnessed an explosive growth of interest in what has been termed 'transformational leadership' (henceforth, TL). The theory is closely linked to the growth in what has been defined as corporate culturism - an emphasis on the importance of coherent cultures, as a means of securing competitive advantage. This article outlines the central components of TL theory, and subjects the concept to a critical analysis. In particular, similarities are identified between the components concerned and the characteristics of leadership practice in organizations generally defined as cults. This connection has been previously unremarked in the literature. These similarities are comprehensively reviewed. Trends towards what can be defined as corporate cultism in modern management practice are also discussed. We conclude that TL models are overly concerned with the achievement of corporate cohesion to the detriment of internal dissent. Such dissent is a vital ingredient of effective decision-making. It is suggested that more inclusive and participatory models of the leadership process are required."

Model testing employed a latent variables partial least squares path analysis procedure.Findings The results of research have shown that leadership characteristics of a school are important factors in promoting systems and structures that enable the school to be effective and improve, in brief, to operate as a learning organization. School leaders need to be skilled in transformational leadership practices which work, directly and indirectly through others, towards bringing about: consensus in the organization's mission; structures for shared decision making; continual learning through reflective practice; high standards of professionalism; and, a supportive and appreciative climate that promotes a culture of trust and collaboration. The LOLSO research also demonstrates that schools can be identified as learning organizations as they establish sequentially systems and structures of operation that promote: a collaborative and trusting work environment; a shared and monitored mission; empowerment of its members to share decision-making, show initiative and take risks; and, on-going challenging and relevant professional development. These school factors of leadership and organizational learning are shown to influence what happens in the core business of the school; the teaching and learning.Value The article answers two fundamental questions: Does the nature of the leadership and the level of organizational learning in schools contribute to school effectiveness and improvement in terms of the extent of students' participation in school, student academic self-concept and engagement with school?

Yet, the implementation of school-wide interventions is complex and can be psychologically taxing for implementing personnel. If evidence-based practice and program (EBP) implementation goes unsupported, implementation challenges might result in chronic stress among school personnel that leads to burnout. While generally effective leadership tends to decrease educator burnout, implementation-specific leadership may also decrease burnout through its strategic supports for EBP implementation. A series of linear regression and path models were used to examine the concurrent association between transformational (e.g., general) and implementation (e.g., strategic) leadership and burnout and its component parts (i.e., emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, personal accomplishment). In a sample of 338 school personnel, we found transformational and implementation leadership were each significantly associated with decreased burnout. However, transformational leadership was not significantly associated with any of the three burnout components, whereas implementation leadership was significantly associated with increased personal accomplishment. These results suggest both general and strategic forms of leadership are key supports for school personnel burnout and as such, leaders may benefit from training to improve each.

In this paper, we argue that these ambivalent findings were due to the oversight of the indirect effects of ICT use mediated by other ICT-related variables. We employed multilevel structural equation modelling to unfold the relationship between students’ ICT use and their academic achievements based on PISA 2015 data. The results indicated that students’ autonomy in ICT use and students’ interest in ICT use were found to have significant positive direct effects on students’ academic achievements at both within-school and between-school levels. These two variables played a significant role in mediating the indirect effects of ICT use outside school for schoolwork and ICT resources on students’ academic achievements. On the contrary, ICT resources and ICT use at school exerted either no direct effect or a negative direct effect on students’ academic achievements and students’ perceived autonomy related to ICT use, suggesting that mere provision and use of ICT resources in school did not necessarily guarantee success in student performance. At the school level, school’s transformational leadership and collaborative climate helped promote students’ autonomy in ICT use © 2022, Educational Technology and Society.All Rights Reserved."

Recently, in the field of education, efforts have been made to develop leadership in a pedagogical, distributed, and transformational manner in the management and teaching teams of institutions in order to improve learning outcomes. The academic community is influenced by an environment of intellectual, social, cultural, and technological development, which converts the beginning teacher into an active agent who must deal with a global reality of uncertain changes. In this context, the collaborative virtual learning environments are assumed as the optimum scenario to board the training and development of the future trainers at university level, generating a critical and reflexive attitude for their formation in the teaching/learning process. The motivation of this paper arises from these reflections with the purpose of analyzing the collaborative spaces in virtual environments as socio-cultural support for university beginning teachers. Based on a qualitative research with a documentary phase, a theoretical comparison was developed to generate analysis categories which allowed to perform a depth interview addressed to teachers from different countries of Latin America and the Caribbean involved in this training.

Design: A large survey based on questionnaires developed from non-school organizations was used to develop a model to test the nature and strength of the relationships between variables and to understand the interactive nature of leadership and organizational learning and their effects on student outcomes. Model testing employed a latent variables partial least squares path analysis procedure. Findings: The results of research have shown that leadership characteristics of a school are important factors in promoting systems and structures that enable the school to be effective and improve, in brief, to operate as a learning organization. School leaders need to be skilled in transformational leadership practices which work, directly and indirectly through others, towards bringing about: consensus in the organization's mission; structures for shared decision making; continual learning through reflective practice; high standards of professionalism; and, a supportive and appreciative climate that promotes a culture of trust and collaboration. The LOLSO research also demonstrates that schools can be identified as learning organizations as they establish sequentially systems and structures of operation that promote: a collaborative and trusting work environment; a shared and monitored mission; empowerment of its members to share decision-making, show initiative and take risks; and, on-going challenging and relevant professional development. These school factors of leadership and organizational learning are shown to influence what happens in the core business of the school; the teaching and learning. Value: The article answers two fundamental questions: Does the nature of the leadership and the level of organizational learning in schools contribute to school effectiveness and improvement in terms of the extent of students' participation in school, student academic self-concept and engagement with school? What is the nature of the relationship between non-academic student measures of participation in school, student self-concept and engagement with school and measures of student retention and academic achievement? © 2011 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Yet, the implementation of school-wide interventions is complex and can be psychologically taxing for implementing personnel. If evidence-based practice and program (EBP) implementation goes unsupported, implementation challenges might result in chronic stress among school personnel that leads to burnout. While generally effective leadership tends to decrease educator burnout, implementation-specific leadership may also decrease burnout through its strategic supports for EBP implementation. A series of linear regression and path models were used to examine the concurrent association between transformational (e.g., general) and implementation (e.g., strategic) leadership and burnout and its component parts (i.e., emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, personal accomplishment). In a sample of 338 school personnel, we found transformational and implementation leadership were each significantly associated with decreased burnout. However, transformational leadership was not significantly associated with any of the three burnout components, whereas implementation leadership was significantly associated with increased personal accomplishment. These results suggest both general and strategic forms of leadership are key supports for school personnel burnout and as such, leaders may benefit from training to improve each. Additional implications for schools and future directions to understand how best to support school personnel are discussed. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."

In the most general form, the material is presented regarding the strategic guidelines for the quality of education in the WHE with special learning conditions in the context of Ukraine's integration into the European educational space. Philosophical and methodological approaches to solving existing disagreements in the field of human measurement of the quality of police education in Ukraine and abroad are studied in integral connection with the corresponding concepts of human development; leadership theories; the genesis of personnel work on professional training and evaluation of the activities of police officers in the system of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Ukraine. Features of the human-measurement training of officers of the National Police of Ukraine are explained on the basis of the provisions of the modern post-non-classical methodology of science, a general scientific holistic approach, humanistic pedagogy, as well as the methodological foundations for the implementation of international standards of ethical behavior in the activities of police officers, which is an objective need of the current Ukrainian education system in general and in particular, a prerequisite for the prevention of corruption offenses, the vitality of virtue in society. The productivity of reflexive practices of self-organization of the personality of future police officers is substantiated as a condition for the development of psychological resilience. The book proves the necessity and prospects of research and implementation in the theory and practice of police education of the concept of Ukrainian general scientific methodology regarding the unity of the formation and development of a Human on the basis of the cognitive-emotional-volitional triad of components of the value experience of the individual. Based on the real originality of the formation of the value experience of a police officer in the process of professional training, constructive practice, the general theoretical and methodological origins and meaningful lines of practical improvement and further personal and professional growth of a police officer in their official activities as mechanisms for protecting human rights and freedoms in the activities of law enforcement officers are identified. The novelty of the approaches is associated with the use of the key foundations of psychopedagogical support and the development of pedagogical skills of HEI teachers with special learning conditions, the activities of mentors to harmonize the professional training of the applicant's personality in the system of departmental education, the use of a criteria approach for assessing learning outcomes, the design features of police work programs in the context of the scale of human-dimensional meanings evaluating the quality of higher education The constructiveness of this perspective is distinguished, first of all, by a holistic combination and use as the latest achievements of the psychological, pedagogical, legal, neurophysiological branches of scientific knowledge to explain the newly formed pedagogical phenomena of the modern educational sphere in the aspect of innovativeness of markers for assessing the quality of educational and research activities education; and the understanding that universal human and nation-creating value orientations as a special social basis of the culturological worldview should be extrapolated into the global function of modern education, which should determine and realize its social power that characterizes civilizational development in different historical epochs.

After teachers and teaching, school leadership is the most important determinant of learner achievement in school. Despite this, there is still uncertainty regarding what successful school leadership is and what successful school leaders do in non-Western contexts. In this mixed methods study I explored successful high school leadership in South Africa. Specifically, a questionnaire was administered to 38 principals from academically high-achieving schools from a range of socioeconomic contexts throughout the Western Cape, and 14 principals were interviewed. An integrated analysis reveals the paradox of uniqueness and universality of successful school leadership in South Africa, outlining that while there is no single best approach, various similarities exist between successful school leaders and established international literature. I found that successful principals adapt to their context, amalgamate transformational, instructional and distributed leadership styles, set direction, develop people, constantly realign the school with teaching and learning, and, importantly, strive to make a difference in the lives of others. It is about leading with Ubuntu. By highlighting these characteristics and practices, I offer theoretical, practical and personal advice to current and aspiring school leaders, academics and policy makers. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."

We used PISA 2015 data covering 6,504 students and 256 school principals from German schools and 9,841 students and 268 school leaders from Chinese schools. Results identified three leadership styles in Germany, namely, transformational (23.4%), instructional (41.3%), and integrated (35.3%) leadership, and two leadership styles in China, namely, transformational (38.6%) and instructional (61.4%) principals. Principals with instructional and integrated leadership had higher student achievements in Germany, whereas only principals with transformational leadership had slightly higher student achievements in China. Moreover, three leadership styles in Germany and two in China showed their relationships with each domain of student achievement.

data_rawScopus_2025-08-23_TL_School_20.ris,ris,Instructional leadership and effective teaching and learning,"Xhomara, N.",2021,,10.52305/pvle5825,,"School leadership has been identified as a key function in assuring quality in education. The instructional leadership model refers to the role and the functions of school leadership to employ different management tasks with regards to teaching and learning. Instructional leadership role includes (a) developing mission and goals, (b) managing the educational production function, (c) promoting an academic learning climate, and (d) developing a supportive work environment. Instructional leaders were described as leading from a combination of both expertise and charisma focused primarily on the improvement of student learning outcomes. The monograph, entitled Instructional Leadership and Effective Teaching and Learning and written by Nazmi Xhomara, is dedicated to school instructional leadership as an important factor that influences teaching and learning at school. In the first chapter, the author presents and analyzes educational leadership vs educational management, as well as models of educational leadership and management. The author argues on the importance of different leadership models, such as managerial leadership, transformational leadership, participative leadership, interpersonal leadership, transactional leadership, postmodern leadership, moral leadership, and contingent leadership. Chapters Two, Three, and Four shed light on instructional leadership and teaching and learning, understanding of instructional leadership, the concept and practice of instructional leadership, instructional school leadership and learning environment, attributes of instructional leaders, instructional excellence, instructional leadership time management, effective teaching and teachers, as well as teaching challenges and learning environment. Meanwhile, the author has analyzed constructivism, student intelligence, understanding of supervision, instructional collegial supervision, supervision approaches, understanding of evaluation of teaching and learning, teacher evaluation, and instructional observing instruments in chapters Five, Six, and Seven. Chapters Eight and Nine are focused especially on the research work of the relationships between instructional leadership and teaching, learning, and students' achievements, as well as on an empirical study designed and conducted in Albania as a case. Chapters Ten and Eleven are dedicated to instructional leadership preparation and the future of instructional leadership. As a conclusion, Xhomara indicates that principals are responsible for developing school climates and cultures that support the very best instructional practices. The new era of instructional leadership has predictably placed significant demands for accountability for student success and equity on the principal as well as for the university programs that prepare them. Working in twenty-first-century schools, the instructional leader is held more accountable than ever for student success. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."
data_rawScopus_2025-08-23_TL_School_20.ris,ris,Connection between Taiwanese research on school leadership and global scholarship: A bibliometric review,"Pan, H.-L.W.; Chen, W.-Y.",2021,Journal of Research in Education Sciences,10.6209/jories.202106_66(2).0006,,"1. Background Systematic reviews may inform public policies and contribute to the building of a knowledge base. However, reviews of school leadership research are relatively rare in Taiwan. This study conducted a bibliometric review to analyze journal papers by Taiwanese scholars in the Scopus database published in the previous 20 years. The focus was to examine the connection between Taiwanese and global research on school leadership. 2. Research questions On the basis of the research background, four research questions were proposed: (1) What is the volume and growth trajectory of Taiwanese school leadership research?(2) What is the international visibility of Taiwanese school leadership research as revealed through citation analysis? (3) What are the main topics covered by Taiwanese school leadership research and how do they correspond to the global trend? (4) What is the intellectual structure of Taiwanese school leadership research and how do it connect with the global literature? 3. Theoretical framework (1) Intellectual development of school leadership research The theory movement in the 1950s and 1960s highlighted the development of educational administration research. Griffiths (1959) categorized these theories into four groups: social system and role theory, leadership theory, decision theory, and organizational theory. In the 1970s,contingency theory, which emphasizes the influence of context on leadership, was proposed. With the growing interest in school effectiveness and school reform, the organizational perspective was applied to investigate school leadership. Instructional leadership was also emphasized from then on. In the 1990s, other leadership approaches such as transformational leadership, moral leadership, and distributed leadership became popular in school leadership research. With the power paradigm shifting from a heroic view of leaders to a more dispersed view of power, distributed leadership and teacher leadership were also highly recognized. In response to the international context, leadership for learning, which includes elements of instructional leadership, transformational leadership, and shared leadership, has gained global attention in the new millennium. (2) Retrospective view of school leadership research Systematic reviews did not appear in the field of educational administration until the 1980s. EPPI-Centre (2012) indicated the four key features of systematic reviews. First, a high quality systematic review is explicit and is conducted using transparent methods. Second, it follows a standard set of stages. Third, the review is accountable, replicable, and updateable. Fourth, users should be involved to ensure reports are relevant and useful. The elements of reviews include the central topics of interest, guiding questions, and goals; a conceptual perspective for guiding there view’s selection, evaluation, and interpretation of the studies; sources and types of data; data evaluation and analysis; and the major results of the review (Hallinger, 2014). However, according to Hallinger’s study in 2014, only eight reviews met these criteria. Of the eight studies, some used critical synthesis, some adopted meta-analysis, and some employed both. In recent years, network analysis, data mining, and bibliometric analysis are increasingly being applied in systematic reviews. In addition to a greater diversity in methods, the regions under review have expanded from the United States and United Kingdom to many other regions. This development can be attributed to Hallinger’s effort to initiate international collaboration to build the knowledge base of educational leadership in Asia. Because of the growing interest in the academic development in non-Western countries, he promoted the use of systematic reviews to examine studies in Asia, Africa, Saudi Arabia, and Central and South America, which resulted in more than 30 systematic reviews on educational leadership and management. A wide range of research topics is a prominent feature of educational leadership and management research. Five topics that have gained frequent attention are social justice, female leadership, school leadership preparation and development, trust, and instruction and instructional leadership. The following are the topics of frontier research in this field: principal, school leadership, and student achievement; distributed leadership, instructional leadership, teacher learning, accountability, school improvement, school reform, and leadership development; and race, justice, and urban education. In Taiwan, research reviews on educational leadership are scant. According to Lin’s (2000) review, only a few studies have focused on the impact of principals on students. Pan’s (2010) review indicated that of all the educational leadership studies in government-funded projects and journals,70% of the topics were related to principals’ leadership styles and behaviors. The distribution of the research topics was not sufficiently diversified to reflect global academic development. 4. Research method This study used bibliometric analysis on the Scopus database to analyze Taiwanese school leadership research. The review process was based on the steps of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) developed by Moher et al. (2009). After the process of screening, identification, eligibility determination, and inclusion, 95 papers were included for analysis. Descriptive analysis, citation analysis, co-occurrence analysis of keywords, and co-citation analysis were conducted to address the research questions. 5. Research findings The study had the following three key findings: (1) Concerning the volume of publication in journals, the first English paper on Taiwanese school leadership research did not appear until 2001.Although the promotion of the world university rankings and the launch of the Top University Project have changed the trend of solely using Chinese for academic writing, the number of English studies on school leadership remains limited. Moreover, only 14.7% of papers are published in the core journals of education leadership and management. (2) A citation analysis revealed that the international visibility of Taiwanese school leadership research is low. The average number of papers of the 10 most cited Taiwanese scholars is 3.5, and they have been cited an average of 45.2times. The number of citations of Taiwanese scholars is 3.33 times less than that of African educational leadership research and 11.78 times less than that of research on three emerging regions. (3) The research topics selected by Taiwanese scholars may highlight international academic development; however, some underdeveloped topics remain such as social justice leadership, organizational theory, institutional theory, and social capital. The current co-citation analysis revealed the four schools of thought of Taiwanese school leadership, namely leadership for learning, distributed forms of leadership, leadership behavior and its impact, and social network. 6. Contributions Systematic reviews on school leadership are scarce in Taiwan. The present study conducted a 206 bibliometric analysis to examine the development and features of Taiwanese school leadership literature which is innovative in the research method. The connection between Taiwanese studies on school leadership research and global scholarship has seldom been addressed in relevant research. The current analysis presents the development of Taiwanese school leadership and its connection with global trends, providing critical insights and directions for future research on school leadership in Taiwan. 7. Implications The present findings indicate the future direction of Taiwanese academic development in the field of educational administration. First, publishing more research in English can help increase the international impact of Taiwanese scholars. Greater exposure in English publications can highlight the fruitful outcome of Taiwanese school leadership research internationally. Building the academic connections between Taiwan and other countries will also be beneficial. Second, the current study identified a gap between Taiwanese school leadership research and the global trend. Including more diversified topics may help broaden the scope of research. Some topics recommended for future study include social justice leadership, organizational theory, institutional theory, social capital theory, social justice theory, and critical racialism. Third, conducting periodic replication studies using bibliometric analysis may help track the development of Taiwanese school leadership research. In particular, this method allows for a comparison of the distinguishing features of research among different periods. Fourth, a bibliometric analysis on Taiwanese school leadership research published in Chinese would be of considerable value. Taiwan has several literature databases that collect domestic research. However, the data structure provides insufficient information for an effective bibliometric analysis. To maximize the usefulness of these databases, their data structure design merits special consideration. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."

A recent US study indicates that despite being raised in elite neighborhoods, Black males raised in affluent conditions are less likely than White males to maintain their wealth status into adulthood. While strong instruction, adult support, and inclusive cultures have been proven to mitigate a myriad of risk factors for historically marginalized groups of students, opportunity gaps continue to face young people of color, even in affluent suburban districts, where the appearance of a level playing field can lead educators to underestimate their role in building social capital in their students. High graduation rates notwithstanding, school leaders in suburban districts must be prepared to lead staff to understand the critical impact of disparities in preparation on the competitiveness of their students of color and firstgeneration students. They must seek to uncover critical differences in how opportunities are parceled out, address subtle barriers to access, resist the “opportunity hoarding” that works to maintain the status quo in many districts, and develop in staff the pedagogical and relational skills that engage students of color in the highest opportunities available to them. Though many school administrators may be White, middle class, and personally unfamiliar with some of the racial and socioeconomic challenges that face many suburban districts today, their effectiveness in eliminating achievement and opportunity gaps will hinge on their ability to prepare all students for competition on a playing field that remains anything but level. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."

Successful leadership is ensured by school leaders’ compliance to a set of basic practices within particular school contexts. The impact of leadership styles on performance, the work environment and job satisfaction is emphasized, while the appropriate leadership style could make teachers more effective in terms of job productivity. The adoption of different leadership styles by school leaders shows positive results with regard to school effectiveness. The purpose of this paper is to describe school leadership styles and the influence the styles have on school performance. Design/methodology/approach: A quantitative approach with a post-positive paradigm was followed. A systematic random sample of 72 secondary schools in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, was selected. The Cronbach’s α coefficient, statistical significance (p-values) and effect size (d-values) were calculated, and a factor analysis was conducted. Findings: The results show a difference between teachers and principals regarding the transformational leadership style. The principals in the high-performing schools were perceived as less passive-avoidant in practice than those in the low-performing schools. A principal manages and leads a school effectively by applying an appropriate leadership style. Research limitations/implications: For future research, it will be advisable to make use of a mixed-method design. Although the Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire addressed numerous aspects of leadership and leadership styles, the “voice” of the respondents lacked. Furthermore, more leadership styles could be investigated in different contexts. Practical implications: A chosen principal leadership style is not necessarily the best style for this purpose. School principals and teachers interpret leadership styles differently. Communication is therefore important. Social implications: The principal leadership style is not always necessarily the teachers’ and learners’ choice. It is important that schools keep up with a constantly changing world. Originality/value: If school principals and teachers agree upon a specific leadership style, there may be better collaboration which enhances better academic performance as well as effectiveness regarding schools. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."

The theory allows for a critical discussion of race, ethnicity, and the influence of community and culture on communications in an urban educational arena. Socioeconomic status is often cited as the most significant correlate to academic achievement.

However, we currently face major challenges to maintain and promote people's health. Although these complicated problems pose numerous threats to public welfare, education of public health for health professionals still retains 20th-century standards. This also means that graduate education of public health in Japan is traditionally based on obtaining licensure as a medical professional, conducting research and writing papers, and on-the-job training. Since graduate school education is expected to produce competent public health leaders, Japan requires a reform toward a new education design that caters to the current societal needs. The current global trend in the education of health professionals leans toward outcome-based education to meet core competencies. Here, ""competency"" refers to a set of features or particular behavioral patterns possessed by highly qualified persons. In 2006, the World Health Organization (WHO) established a general health professional competency standard that includes both management and leadership competencies. Moreover, the Lancet Commission concluded that there was a need for transformative education based on a ""health system approach."" In brief, this means that our education should correspond to the needs of the health system to allow for the resolution of problems by educated professionals with satisfactory levels of competencies. In addition, as ""change agents,"" these competent professionals are expected to promote societal change toward the realization of better public health. In Japan, the Central Education Council has produced several reports on professional graduate school reform since 2000. These reports indicate that graduate school curricula require reform to allow the health professionals to work locally and globally, as well as to solve problems through the application of systematic knowledge that matches practice with theory. Therefore, with reference to the current Japanese health situation, global trends in education, and the Japanese educational policies, transformational changes are needed toward a new era of Japanese public health education specifically through outcome-based education to improve the health professionals competencies. We hope that education in the new schools of public health will contribute to solve authentic public health problems and create a healthy future with competent professionals.

Revista Iberoamericana Sobre Calidad, Eficacia y Cambio en Educacion",,,"The purpose of this study was to examine the relative impact of different types of leadership on students’ academic and nonacademic outcomes. The methodology involved an analysis of findings from 27 published studies of the relationship between leadership and student outcomes. The first meta-analysis, including 22 of the 7 studies, involved a comparison of the effects of transformational and instructional leadership on student outcomes. The second meta-analysis involved a comparison of the effects of five inductively derived sets of leadership practices on student outcomes. Twelve of the studies contributed to this second analysis. The first meta-analysis indicated that the average effect of instructional leadership on student outcomes was three to four times that of transformational leadership. Inspection of the survey items used to measure school leadership revealed five sets of leadership practices or dimensions: establishing goals and expectations; resourcing strategically; planning, coordinating, and evaluating teaching and the curriculum; promoting and participating in teacher learning and development, and ensuring an orderly and supportive environment. The second meta-analysis revealed strong average effects for the leadership dimension involving promoting and participating in teacher learning and development and moderate effects for the dimensions concerned with goal setting and planning, coordinating, and evaluating teaching and the curriculum. The comparisons between transformational and instructional leadership and between the five leadership dimensions suggested that the more leaders focus their relationships, their work, and their learning on the core business of teaching and learning, the greater their influence on student outcomes.

Research Methods: The schools were selected from a geographically stratified sample of public middle schools in a state in the southeastern United States. Multiple linear regression was used to identify schools performing better than expected considering their levels of poverty and other school-related factors. The final three schools, one from each geographic region, showed steady increases in academic achievement and school climate following the arrival of their principals. Data were primarily collected from interviews with principals, teaching and nonteaching staff, and parents using protocols adapted from the International Successful School Principalship Project. Findings: The findings explicate the large degree to which the leadership practices and beliefs that influenced student achievement in these schools were adapted to and commensurate with each school's immediate context. Furthermore, they illustrate how principals used these practices to institutionalize school-wide reform efforts as vehicles for leading change within their schools. Implications: The findings substantiate research on successful school leadership in high-needs middle schools. They also extend this research by examining the way core transformational and instructional leadership practices can be adapted to suit various school contexts and institutionalize school-wide reform efforts to enhance student learning. Further research is required to understand how principals decide to adapt their leadership practices, and how aspiring leaders can best learn to do so. © The University Council for Educational Administration 2013. © 2013 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."

Because implicit biases that stereotypically masculine behaviors are required for effective leadership remain strong, examining faculty members' perceptions of their chair's leadership in medical school departments with women chairs can provide insight into the views of women leaders in academic medicine and the complex ways in which gender may impact these chairs' leadership style and actions. Methods: We conducted semistructured interviews with 13 male and 15 female faculty members representing all faculty tracks in three clinical departments chaired by women. Inductive, qualitative analysis of the subsequent text allowed themes to emerge across interviews. Results: Four themes emerged regarding departmental leadership. One dealt with the leadership of the previous chair. The other three described the current chair's characteristics (tough, direct, and transparent), her use of communal actions to help support and mentor her faculty, and her ability to build power through consensus. Because all three chairs were early in their tenure, a wait and see attitude was frequently expressed. Faculty generally viewed having a woman chair as an indication of positive change, with potential individual and institutional advantages. Conclusions: This exploratory study suggests that the culture of academic medicine has moved beyond questioning women physicians' competence to lead once they are in top organizational leadership positions. The findings are also consonant with experimental research indicating that women leaders are most successful when they pair stereotypic male (agentic) behaviors with stereotypic female (communal) behaviors. All three chairs exhibited features of a transformational leadership style and characteristics deemed essential for effective leadership in academic medicine.

Recognizing the critical need for specialized programs to support gifted students, this research employs a quasi-experimental design to evaluate the effectiveness of the Integrated Curriculum Model (ICM). Participants included sixth-grade students from two groups: an experimental group receiving the ICM intervention and a control group following the standard curriculum. We collected data using structured questionnaires and analyzed the results using mean, standard deviation, and t-tests to determine statistically significant differences between the groups. Findings revealed that the experimental group showed significantly higher improvements in both verbal-linguistic intelligence and leadership skills compared to the control group, with a significance level of.05. These results underscore the importance of tailored educational strategies in unlocking the full potential of gifted students. The study’s theoretical implications highlight the applicability of Gardner’s Theory of Multiple Intelligences and Burns’ Transformational Leadership Theory in educational settings. Practically, the findings provide valuable insights for educators, policymakers, and parents on the benefits of specialized programs for gifted students, suggesting that such interventions can also positively impact typically developing children.

Background Systematic reviews may inform public policies and contribute to the building of a knowledge base. However, reviews of school leadership research are relatively rare in Taiwan. This study conducted a bibliometric review to analyze journal papers by Taiwanese scholars in the Scopus database published in the previous 20 years. The focus was to examine the connection between Taiwanese and global research on school leadership. 2. Research questions On the basis of the research background, four research questions were proposed: (1) What is the volume and growth trajectory of Taiwanese school leadership research?(2) What is the international visibility of Taiwanese school leadership research as revealed through citation analysis? (3) What are the main topics covered by Taiwanese school leadership research and how do they correspond to the global trend? (4) What is the intellectual structure of Taiwanese school leadership research and how do it connect with the global literature? 3. Theoretical framework (1) Intellectual development of school leadership research The theory movement in the 1950s and 1960s highlighted the development of educational administration research. Griffiths (1959) categorized these theories into four groups: social system and role theory, leadership theory, decision theory, and organizational theory. In the 1970s,contingency theory, which emphasizes the influence of context on leadership, was proposed. With the growing interest in school effectiveness and school reform, the organizational perspective was applied to investigate school leadership. Instructional leadership was also emphasized from then on. In the 1990s, other leadership approaches such as transformational leadership, moral leadership, and distributed leadership became popular in school leadership research. With the power paradigm shifting from a heroic view of leaders to a more dispersed view of power, distributed leadership and teacher leadership were also highly recognized. In response to the international context, leadership for learning, which includes elements of instructional leadership, transformational leadership, and shared leadership, has gained global attention in the new millennium. (2) Retrospective view of school leadership research Systematic reviews did not appear in the field of educational administration until the 1980s. EPPI-Centre (2012) indicated the four key features of systematic reviews. First, a high quality systematic review is explicit and is conducted using transparent methods. Second, it follows a standard set of stages. Third, the review is accountable, replicable, and updateable. Fourth, users should be involved to ensure reports are relevant and useful. The elements of reviews include the central topics of interest, guiding questions, and goals; a conceptual perspective for guiding there view’s selection, evaluation, and interpretation of the studies; sources and types of data; data evaluation and analysis; and the major results of the review (Hallinger, 2014). However, according to Hallinger’s study in 2014, only eight reviews met these criteria. Of the eight studies, some used critical synthesis, some adopted meta-analysis, and some employed both. In recent years, network analysis, data mining, and bibliometric analysis are increasingly being applied in systematic reviews. In addition to a greater diversity in methods, the regions under review have expanded from the United States and United Kingdom to many other regions. This development can be attributed to Hallinger’s effort to initiate international collaboration to build the knowledge base of educational leadership in Asia. Because of the growing interest in the academic development in non-Western countries, he promoted the use of systematic reviews to examine studies in Asia, Africa, Saudi Arabia, and Central and South America, which resulted in more than 30 systematic reviews on educational leadership and management. A wide range of research topics is a prominent feature of educational leadership and management research. Five topics that have gained frequent attention are social justice, female leadership, school leadership preparation and development, trust, and instruction and instructional leadership. The following are the topics of frontier research in this field: principal, school leadership, and student achievement; distributed leadership, instructional leadership, teacher learning, accountability, school improvement, school reform, and leadership development; and race, justice, and urban education. In Taiwan, research reviews on educational leadership are scant. According to Lin’s (2000) review, only a few studies have focused on the impact of principals on students. Pan’s (2010) review indicated that of all the educational leadership studies in government-funded projects and journals,70% of the topics were related to principals’ leadership styles and behaviors. The distribution of the research topics was not sufficiently diversified to reflect global academic development. 4. Research method This study used bibliometric analysis on the Scopus database to analyze Taiwanese school leadership research. The review process was based on the steps of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) developed by Moher et al. (2009). After the process of screening, identification, eligibility determination, and inclusion, 95 papers were included for analysis. Descriptive analysis, citation analysis, co-occurrence analysis of keywords, and co-citation analysis were conducted to address the research questions. 5. Research findings The study had the following three key findings: (1) Concerning the volume of publication in journals, the first English paper on Taiwanese school leadership research did not appear until 2001.Although the promotion of the world university rankings and the launch of the Top University Project have changed the trend of solely using Chinese for academic writing, the number of English studies on school leadership remains limited. Moreover, only 14.7% of papers are published in the core journals of education leadership and management. (2) A citation analysis revealed that the international visibility of Taiwanese school leadership research is low. The average number of papers of the 10 most cited Taiwanese scholars is 3.5, and they have been cited an average of 45.2times. The number of citations of Taiwanese scholars is 3.33 times less than that of African educational leadership research and 11.78 times less than that of research on three emerging regions. (3) The research topics selected by Taiwanese scholars may highlight international academic development; however, some underdeveloped topics remain such as social justice leadership, organizational theory, institutional theory, and social capital. The current co-citation analysis revealed the four schools of thought of Taiwanese school leadership, namely leadership for learning, distributed forms of leadership, leadership behavior and its impact, and social network. 6. Contributions Systematic reviews on school leadership are scarce in Taiwan. The present study conducted a 206 bibliometric analysis to examine the development and features of Taiwanese school leadership literature which is innovative in the research method. The connection between Taiwanese studies on school leadership research and global scholarship has seldom been addressed in relevant research. The current analysis presents the development of Taiwanese school leadership and its connection with global trends, providing critical insights and directions for future research on school leadership in Taiwan. 7. Implications The present findings indicate the future direction of Taiwanese academic development in the field of educational administration. First, publishing more research in English can help increase the international impact of Taiwanese scholars. Greater exposure in English publications can highlight the fruitful outcome of Taiwanese school leadership research internationally. Building the academic connections between Taiwan and other countries will also be beneficial. Second, the current study identified a gap between Taiwanese school leadership research and the global trend. Including more diversified topics may help broaden the scope of research. Some topics recommended for future study include social justice leadership, organizational theory, institutional theory, social capital theory, social justice theory, and critical racialism. Third, conducting periodic replication studies using bibliometric analysis may help track the development of Taiwanese school leadership research. In particular, this method allows for a comparison of the distinguishing features of research among different periods. Fourth, a bibliometric analysis on Taiwanese school leadership research published in Chinese would be of considerable value. Taiwan has several literature databases that collect domestic research. However, the data structure provides insufficient information for an effective bibliometric analysis. To maximize the usefulness of these databases, their data structure design merits special consideration. © 2021, National Taiwan Normal University. All rights reserved."

Information and Communication Technology (ICT) leadership supports effective instructional practices through a combination of interpersonal skills, knowledge of a variety of current technology applications, and the vision to anticipate future technology-based solutions for education. The potential benefits of good ICT leadership can include improved academic achievement by students, improved student attendance and reduced attrition, better vocational preparation of students, more efficient administrative operations, and reduced teacher/staff burnout and turnover. The main objectives of this study are to investigate principals’ ICT leadership practices in their respective colleges and the methods and strategies principals use to lead technology integration into the educational environment. Qualitative as well as quantitative data were collected by means of semi-structured interviews and questionnaires that were administered to teachers and principals of professional colleges. This study reveals that technology integration as an instructional strategy needs to be learned in the wider context of changing pedagogy and paradigms of thought about technology use in education.

Drawing on Bandura’s social cognitive theory, a quantitative cross-sectional design was employed to collect data from 1,034 students at five different Chinese Higher Vocational Colleges. These findings indicate that transformational leadership positively affects student engagement and self-efficacy. Their sense of self-efficacy moderated the relationship between leadership and student involvement. This study adopted structural equation modeling, which confirms the proposed relationships’ robustness. However, some limitations, such as the cultural context and limited representativeness, should be considered for future studies. Policymakers and practitioners in education can use these findings to inform efforts to enhance vocational education instruction and student achievements. Implications for practice include suggestions for bettering programs that support teacher leadership and for including self-efficacy tests in educational policies to increase student involvement.

The purpose of this paper is to contribute to the current literature by empirically testing the relationships between the principal leadership and the teacher self-efficacy, a construct which has a proven impact on student achievement. The role of collective efficacy on the relationship between transformational leadership of principals and self-efficacy of teachers was a special focus for the study. Design/methodology/approach: A causal comparative research design was employed to study the direct, indirect, and mediating relationships among principal leadership, teacher self-efficacy, and collective efficacy in schools. The participants included a cluster-random sample of 813 primary school teachers. Data gathering instruments composed of a combination of the Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire, the Collective Teacher Efficacy Scale and the Teacher's Sense of Efficacy Scale. A structural equation modelling with path analysis was employed to test the research models and hypotheses. Findings: Findings of the study demonstrated that collective efficacy and transformation leadership jointly shape teachers' self-efficacy. There was a significant relationship between principals' transformational leadership and teachers' self-efficacy beliefs. This relationship was mediated and magnified by collective efficacy in schools. Research limitations/implications: The study has the common limitations of the self-reported perceptions of participants. Originality/value: The study enlightened the little-known causal relationship mechanisms through which transformational leadership practices of principals and collective efficacy of schools affect the self-efficacy beliefs of teachers. The findings are in line with the socio-cognitive theory which assumes the presence of reciprocal relationships among leadership, organization, and person domains in shaping organizational behaviors of teachers. The study also parallels with the emerging literature about the mediating effects of collective efficacy on the relationship between principal transformational leadership and teacher self-efficacy. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited."

Revista Iberoamericana Sobre Calidad, Eficacia y Cambio en Educacion",,,"The purpose of this study was to examine the relative impact of different types of leadership on students’ academic and nonacademic outcomes. The methodology involved an analysis of findings from 27 published studies of the relationship between leadership and student outcomes. The first meta-analysis, including 22 of the 7 studies, involved a comparison of the effects of transformational and instructional leadership on student outcomes. The second meta-analysis involved a comparison of the effects of five inductively derived sets of leadership practices on student outcomes. Twelve of the studies contributed to this second analysis. The first meta-analysis indicated that the average effect of instructional leadership on student outcomes was three to four times that of transformational leadership. Inspection of the survey items used to measure school leadership revealed five sets of leadership practices or dimensions: establishing goals and expectations; resourcing strategically; planning, coordinating, and evaluating teaching and the curriculum; promoting and participating in teacher learning and development, and ensuring an orderly and supportive environment. The second meta-analysis revealed strong average effects for the leadership dimension involving promoting and participating in teacher learning and development and moderate effects for the dimensions concerned with goal setting and planning, coordinating, and evaluating teaching and the curriculum. The comparisons between transformational and instructional leadership and between the five leadership dimensions suggested that the more leaders focus their relationships, their work, and their learning on the core business of teaching and learning, the greater their influence on student outcomes. The article concludes with a discussion of the need for leadership research and practice to be more closely linked to the evidence on effective teaching and effective teacher learning. Such alignment could increase the impact of school leadership on student outcomes even further. © 2014 Universidad Autonoma de Madrid. All rights reserved."

A Latent Class Analysis of Principal Perception of Leadership,"Urick, A.; Bowers, A.J.",2014,Educational Administration Quarterly,10.1177/0013161x13489019,,"Purpose: Effective styles of principal leadership can help address multiple issues in struggling schools, such as low student achievement and high rates of teacher attrition. Although the literature has nominated certain ""idealized"" leadership styles as being more or less effective, such as transformational, instructional, and shared instructional leadership, we have little evidence about how principals may or may not choose to practice these styles across U.S. schools. Research Design: Latent class analysis was used to identify different types of principals across the United States. We analyzed the 1999-2000 Schools and Staffing Survey as it presents a unique opportunity to study the different types of U.S. principals since it contains leadership measures not found in other national surveys. A final sample of 7,650 public schools and principals was included in the analysis. Findings: Instead of idealized leadership styles signifying variations in practice, the differences between types of principals were defined by the degree of principal and teacher leadership. Further, the school and principal context, such as school size, urbanicity, accountability performance, and principal background, predicted the three significantly different principal types: controlling, frequent principal leadership; balkanizing, high degree of leadership shared with teachers; or integrating, frequent principal leadership as well as a high degree of leadership shared with teachers. Conclusions: These types suggest that principals simultaneously practice leadership behaviors associated with multiple leadership styles in accordance with their background and school context. These findings provide support for the use of more complex models to assess school leader effectiveness. © The University Council for Educational Administration 2013."

This current study was initiated due to the prevalence of low student achievement as well as the observed controversies regarding effective types of leadership behaviors in secondary schools in the Gedeo Zone of Ethiopia. The aim of the study was to examine the effect of secondary school principals’ leadership behaviors on student outcomes in the zone and consequently to identify effective types of leadership constructs that could enhance learners’ success. An explanatory sequential mixed-design approach was used with a sample of six schools which were chosen by using a maximum variation strategy. Out of these six sampled schools, eighteen (18) participants, comprising of six (6) principals, four (4) district supervisors, two (2) zone education experts and six (6) PTSA chairmen were chosen for the qualitative phase. These participants were selected purposively as they have a better understanding, by virtue of their position regarding the effect of principals’ leadership behavior on student achievement. A close-ended questionnaire was used to collect quantitative data, while interviews and document analysis were used as research instruments in the qualitative phase. The findings of this study indicate that effective practicing of a combination of instructional and transformational leadership behaviors, in integrative ways, enhances student outcomes. ©Authors."

Research has shown associations between TFL and various athlete outcomes in Western sports contexts. However, limited attention has been paid to how cultural factors shape these relationships in East Asian settings, particularly within Japanese sports culture that emphasizes hierarchical relationships and collectivist values. Methods: The study included 112 first-year undergraduate students from a sports science program at a Japanese university. Athletes' perceptions of their coaches' TFL behaviors and PYD outcomes were assessed using the Differentiated Transformational Leadership Inventory for Youth Sport (DTLI-YS) and the Youth Experience Survey for Sport (YES-S). Results: Correlation analyses revealed a particularly strong association between high performance expectations and initiative (r =.53, p <.01), notable when compared to American research where correlations between PYD outcomes and TFL dimensions were typically weaker (r =.11 –.43). Regression analyses further showed that high performance expectations were significantly associated with both goal setting (β =.29, p <.05) and initiative (β =.39, p <.01). Analysis by competition level revealed significant differences in initiative (F = 4.07, p <.01, η² =.10) and total YES-S scores (F = 2.75, p <.05, η² =.07). Discussion: These findings contribute to understanding how cultural context shapes the relationship between coaching leadership and youth development in sports. While the prominence of high performance expectations reflects Japanese sports culture's emphasis on discipline and collective achievement, results suggest the importance of incorporating a more balanced leadership approach that includes elements beyond high performance expectations to foster comprehensive athlete development. 2025 Nakayama and Izawa."
data_rawScopus_2025-08-23_TL_StudentAchievement_116.ris,ris,Critical play: New paradigms for promoting student achievement and excellence,"Barber, W.",2016,"Student Achievement: Perspectives, Assessment and Improvement Strategies",,,"In spheres beyond the student achievement literature, the notion of excellence includes consideration not only of the individual behaviors that represent excellence in action, but also the conditions or environments that foster or provide opportunities for growth in this direction. Unless the conditions for excellence to occur are present, this quality may remain inert. Emerging from this chapter is the concept of “critical playing."" Reaching beyond critical thinking, “critical playing” engages the learners’ physical, emotional, social, intellectual and spiritual selves. It is a qualitative state of excellence which can exist in both teachers and students, whereby individuals are deeply connected to themselves, the lesson content, and their interactions with others in a healthy school community. Authors have referred to this concept of “flow” to describe when students are performing at their potential (Csikzenmihalyi, 1980). Educational environments that nurture both “critical playing” and “flow” foster a rich environment to promote student achievement. This chapter suggests that there are individual and organizational factors which enhance the development of high performing students, by building a culture of achievement, thereby allowing these teachers to inspire critical playing, flow and excellence in their students. First, the notions of expertise and excellence in individual students are examined using Bereiter and Scardamalia’s (1993) research on expertise. Orlick’s (1992) Wheel of Excellence involves several key traits in the individual high performer which are indicators of excellence. These characteristics include “commitment, belief in oneself, full focus, distraction control, constructive evaluation, positive images and mental readiness” (p. 110). Orlick’s examination of high performers in many professional fields is comparable to the characteristics needed by students to excel. These characteristics needed to be successful are also reiterated by the Conference Board of Canada Employability Skills (2016) and the Davos World Conference (2015) on skills needed to excel for 2020. The second key element in this conceptual framework is an investigation of the organizational parameters which affect student excellence. Many authors have studied the primary factors which are considered to be indicators of a high-performing educational organization (Carter, 2002; Meehan, Wiersma, Cowley, Craig, Orletsky & Childers, 2002; Trimble, 2002; Cibulka & Nakayama, 2000). In this research, Cibulka and Nakayama’s (2000) work identifies some characteristics of high-performing schools, including a “collaborative culture, transformational leadership, reflective practice, an ethic of interpersonal caring, increasing standards of professional development, and accountability for high standards” (p. 23). A third critical element in this framework is the impact of health promoting schools on both student achievement and teacher performance. A great deal of research supports the idea that the characteristics of a healthy school are also key features of an institution which nurtures student and teacher excellence (Anderson, 2002; Laforet-Fleisser & Mitchell, 2002; Youngs, 1993; Anderson & Piran, 2001). Finally, the paper will address the integration of these themes as they are ubiquitously woven through the student-centred learning experience. Students are encouraged to strive for excellence if each of these three elements are present in the learning environment achievements. © 2017 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc."

While local contexts will always be central to these choices, results of research ought to provide useful points of departure. But determining what relevant evidence recommends, local context aside, is far more difficult that the admonition to be ‘evidence informed’ seems to imply and the research community has offered few systematic solutions to the problem. This paper offers one possible solution, the calculation of ‘Power Indices’ using, for the purposes of illustration, evidence about the effects of a selected set of potential school improvement priorities (teachers’ emotions) on student learning, in combination with evidence about the effects on teacher emotions of a selected set of transformational leadership practices. Results argue for the value of a unique line of future research enabling school leaders to make choices about both school improvement priorities and how they might best pursue those priorities that systematically reflect the results of relevant evidence. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."

Research Methods: Empirical data were drawn from a 3-year mixed-methods national study (“Impact Study”) that investigated associations between the work of principals in effective and improving primary and secondary schools in England and student outcomes as defined (but not confined) by their national examination and assessment results over 3 years. The research began with a critical survey of the extant literature, followed by a national survey that explored principals’ and key staff’s perceptions of school improvement strategies and actions that they believed had helped foster better student attainment. This was complemented by multiperspective in-depth case studies of a subsample of 20 schools. Findings: The research provides new empirical evidence of how successful principals directly and indirectly achieve and sustain improvement over time through combining both transformational and instructional leadership strategies. The findings show that schools’ abilities to improve and sustain effectiveness over the long term are not primarily the result of the principals’ leadership style but of their understanding and diagnosis of the school’s needs and their application of clearly articulated, organizationally shared educational values through multiple combinations and accumulations of time and context-sensitive strategies that are “layered” and progressively embedded in the school’s work, culture, and achievements. Implications: Mixed-methods research designs are likely to provide finer grained, more nuanced evidence-based understandings of the leadership roles and behaviors of principals who achieve and sustain educational outcomes in schools than single lens quantitative analyses, meta-analyses, or purely qualitative approaches. The findings themselves provide support for more differentiated, context sensitive training and development for aspiring and serving principals. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016."

A recent US study indicates that despite being raised in elite neighborhoods, Black males raised in affluent conditions are less likely than White males to maintain their wealth status into adulthood. While strong instruction, adult support, and inclusive cultures have been proven to mitigate a myriad of risk factors for historically marginalized groups of students, opportunity gaps continue to face young people of color, even in affluent suburban districts, where the appearance of a level playing field can lead educators to underestimate their role in building social capital in their students. High graduation rates notwithstanding, school leaders in suburban districts must be prepared to lead staff to understand the critical impact of disparities in preparation on the competitiveness of their students of color and firstgeneration students. They must seek to uncover critical differences in how opportunities are parceled out, address subtle barriers to access, resist the “opportunity hoarding” that works to maintain the status quo in many districts, and develop in staff the pedagogical and relational skills that engage students of color in the highest opportunities available to them. Though many school administrators may be White, middle class, and personally unfamiliar with some of the racial and socioeconomic challenges that face many suburban districts today, their effectiveness in eliminating achievement and opportunity gaps will hinge on their ability to prepare all students for competition on a playing field that remains anything but level. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020."

Results from meta-analytic structural equation modelling (MASEM),"Ozdogru, M.; Tulubas, T.; Karakose, T.; Kanadlı, S.; Kardas, A.; Papadakis, S.",2025,Acta Psychologica,10.1016/j.actpsy.2025.105144,,"Principal leadership behaviors affect the improvement of school outcomes significantly, not only by providing psychological and professional support for teachers but also by facilitating a positive learning environment at school. This has cultivated both policy and research interest in understanding how principals' leadership behaviors can leverage student outcomes both directly and indirectly through teachers. In this quest, three leadership models have become prominent due to their close relation to classroom instruction and learning: instructional, transformational, and distributed leadership. The current study aims to reveal the relationships between these leadership behaviors of principals and student outcomes as well as assess the mediating effect of teacher self-efficacy on this relationship. Utilizing meta-analytic structural equation modelling (MASEM) methodology, the study analyzes data from prior studies to offer a more comprehensive and holistic analysis of the complex relationships between the variables. The analysis of data from 90 studies showed that all three leadership behaviors affected student outcomes both directly and indirectly through teacher self-efficacy. They also had a moderate direct influence on teacher self-efficacy, while teacher self-efficacy had a moderate effect on student outcomes. These results reiterate the significance of principals' leadership for learning to facilitate student outcomes and suggest that the integrated practice of leadership in accordance with contextual requirements could leverage the effectiveness and improvement of schools. © 2025 The Authors"

Furthermore, the study examines the roles of psychological capital, self-regulation, and conscientiousness in the relationship between psychological capital and academic achievement. A questionnaire survey method and convenience sampling were used to collect 719 formal questionnaires. The research results indicate that universities of applied sciences in Hebei Province, China, perceive that a teacher’s transformational leadership has a significant positive impact on students’ academic achievement. Moreover, perceiving a teacher’s transformational leadership has a significant positive impact on students’ psychological capital and self-regulation, both of which have a significant positive impact on academic achievement. Psychological capital and self-regulation mediate the relationship between teachers’ transformational leadership and students’ academic achievement. Furthermore, conscientiousness moderates the relationship between psychological capital and academic achievement. © 2024 Common Ground Research Networks. All rights reserved."

Among various leadership styles, transformational leadership, with its emphasis on vision, support, and innovation, stands out due to its potential to maximize performance and foster school success. The objective of this research is to translate and culturally adapt the Global Transformational Leadership Scale (GTL) by Carless et al. (2000) into Turkish, with a focus on its application in educational institutions. The adaptation process followed a rigorous methodology to ensure the scale's semantic and conceptual equivalence in Turkish culture. This process involved translation, back-translation, and revisions based on expert feedback. The research was conducted with a sample of 322 teachers from a mid-sized city in eastern Türkiye, and data collection took place in three phases: linguistic equivalence testing with English teachers, parallel testing with the Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire and other relevant scales, and test-retest reliability analysis. CFA was performed to verify the scale's factor structure, and various validity and reliability measures were assessed, including convergent validity, nomological validity, and measurement invariance across gender, education level, and tenure. The results indicated that the adapted GTL scale is a reliable and valid instrument for measuring transformational leadership in Turkish educational institutions. © 2024, Dokuz Eylul University.

Furthermore, as enhancing the quality of living is one of the main programs fostered by Saudi 2030 vision, increasing societal awareness and involvement in adopting life style changes becomes of crucial importance. In alignment with Prince Sultan University strategic plan, the Environment students club took the initiative of a comprehensive campaign under the title of Go Green I & II (2017 & 19 respectively). The campaign aims at enhancing students' involvement to adopt green living and recycling concepts in daily life. It also aims at reducing waste and transforming the campus to an environment friendly domain. More importantly the campaign fosters students' leadership by enabling students to take the initiative and create, invent and implement the targeted changes which guarantee continuity and sustainability. The current study examines the experiment employed at the campaign and proposes pedagogical measures that maintain the achievements and augment students' involvement in the future. Adopting multidisciplinary dialogic methodology, this case study briefly demonstrates the pedagogical approaches selected in the campaigns such as implementation of zero paper courses, and designing contemporary and efficient recycling pins. Employing the theoretical concepts of collaborative learning and green design frameworks this paper aims at: 1) examining the Go Green Campaign and its alignment with PSU's strategic plan and the Saudi 2030 National Transformational Plan, 2) investigating the pedagogical approaches employed such as collaborative learning and their effectiveness in reaching assigned goals, 3) proposing future approaches to enhance students and societal involvement in implementing sustainability and green living procedures. © IEOM Society International."

Utilizing a systematic grounded theory method (SGTM), we conducted research in the provinces of Amasya, Çorum, Samsun, and Tokat in Türkiye. Purposeful and theoretical sampling methods were employed to recruit successful school principals, deputy principals, teachers, students, and parents from secondary schools affiliated with the Ministry of National Education (MoNE). The data draws on unstructured individual and focus group interviews, as well as documents and observations. All the data obtained were inductively analyzed through open, axis, and selective coding stages. Based on the codes, sub-categories, categories, themes, and dimensions from the analyses, we designed the Contextual Successful School Principalship Model (CSSPM), which falls into four dimensions as follows: individual, managerial, organizational, and instructional. SSPs in this study mostly tend to display paternalistic leadership attitudes and behaviors in terms of dedication and self-sacrifice, serving, intrinsic motivation, and influencing stakeholders. They exhibit almost all the attitudes and behaviors of servant leadership, act according to some national and moral values, and experience national attitudes such as patriotism and nationalism intensely. By giving importance to the academic socialization of students' mothers, successful school principals exhibit transformational and instructional leadership behaviors.

Given the growing evidence showing the positive effects of transformational leadership on various school outcomes as it relates to school environment, teacher and student achievement, we wanted to explore the factors that gave rise to transformational leadership. The purpose of this study was to identify and compare the antecedents fostering transformational leadership in the contexts of both the United States and China. This paper reviews and discusses the empirical studies of the last two decades, concentrating on the variables that are antecedent to transformational leadership mainly in the educational context, but also in public management, business and psychology. Results show that transformational leadership is related to three sets of antecedents, which include: (1) the leader’s qualities (e.g., self-efficacy, values, traits, emotional intelligence); (2) organizational features (e.g., organization fairness); and (3) the leader’s colleagues’ characteristics (e.g., follower’s initial developmental level).

Design/methodology/approach – Guided by strong evidence from theories on school leadership and work psychology, the authors hypothesized relations among dimensions of principals’ instructional and transformational leadership behaviors, teachers’ perception of the school climate (social and affective, and physical environment), their job satisfaction and student achievement. The benefits of the principal’s leadership behaviors for student achievement are primarily hypothesized as indirect, with either a weak or statistically non-significant direct positive effect on student outcomes. Path modeling was applied to validate a mediated-effects model using cross-sectional survey data (306 principals, 1,539 teachers) obtained from 306 secondary schools in the two Indian metropolitan cities of New Delhi and Kolkata. Findings – Principal leadership behaviors were not associated directly with either teacher job satisfaction or school-aggregated student achievement. Rather, the transformational leader behavior showed an indirect effect, through the social and affective component of the school climate, on teacher job satisfaction. The physical climate, however, appeared to play a dominating role in mediating the instructional leadership effects on teacher job satisfaction. Comparing the relative indirect effect sizes of the instructional and transformational leadership behaviors on student achievement, principals appear to favor the former approach. Originality/value – This study provides further empirical evidence that instructional leadership better captures the impact of school leadership on student outcomes, when compared to its transformational counterpart. By identifying the relative effects of different leadership practices, school leaders and educational practitioners can focus more on altering the distribution and frequency of those practices that work best for ameliorating student achievement levels. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited."

In this research, we examined the relationship between integrated leadership and teacher professional learning and teacher practices in Turkey, where educational policy makers have recently introduced several school reform initiatives. More specifically, we aimed to examine the moderating function of transformational leadership in the relationship between instructional leadership and teacher practices, with an emphasis on the mediating role of teacher professional learning. Research Design: We conducted this study with a cross-sectional design and moderated mediation model. Data collected from 616 teachers working in a mix of primary and secondary schools in Turkey were analyzed using structural equation modeling and bootstrapping tests. Findings: We found evidence that transformational leadership acted as a moderator of the indirect effect of principal instructional leadership on teachers' instructional practices through teacher professional learning. Implications: This study adds to the accumulated body of knowledge on the effects of school leadership by concluding that the effect of instructional leadership on teacher learning and practice is contingent upon the extent to which principals enact transformational leadership.

In this paper, we argue that these ambivalent findings were due to the oversight of the indirect effects of ICT use mediated by other ICT-related variables. We employed multilevel structural equation modelling to unfold the relationship between students’ ICT use and their academic achievements based on PISA 2015 data. The results indicated that students’ autonomy in ICT use and students’ interest in ICT use were found to have significant positive direct effects on students’ academic achievements at both within-school and between-school levels. These two variables played a significant role in mediating the indirect effects of ICT use outside school for schoolwork and ICT resources on students’ academic achievements. On the contrary, ICT resources and ICT use at school exerted either no direct effect or a negative direct effect on students’ academic achievements and students’ perceived autonomy related to ICT use, suggesting that mere provision and use of ICT resources in school did not necessarily guarantee success in student performance. At the school level, school’s transformational leadership and collaborative climate helped promote students’ autonomy in ICT use © 2022, Educational Technology and Society.All Rights Reserved."

Design: A large survey based on questionnaires developed from non-school organizations was used to develop a model to test the nature and strength of the relationships between variables and to understand the interactive nature of leadership and organizational learning and their effects on student outcomes. Model testing employed a latent variables partial least squares path analysis procedure. Findings: The results of research have shown that leadership characteristics of a school are important factors in promoting systems and structures that enable the school to be effective and improve, in brief, to operate as a learning organization. School leaders need to be skilled in transformational leadership practices which work, directly and indirectly through others, towards bringing about: consensus in the organization's mission; structures for shared decision making; continual learning through reflective practice; high standards of professionalism; and, a supportive and appreciative climate that promotes a culture of trust and collaboration. The LOLSO research also demonstrates that schools can be identified as learning organizations as they establish sequentially systems and structures of operation that promote: a collaborative and trusting work environment; a shared and monitored mission; empowerment of its members to share decision-making, show initiative and take risks; and, on-going challenging and relevant professional development. These school factors of leadership and organizational learning are shown to influence what happens in the core business of the school; the teaching and learning.

We used PISA 2015 data covering 6,504 students and 256 school principals from German schools and 9,841 students and 268 school leaders from Chinese schools. Results identified three leadership styles in Germany, namely, transformational (23.4%), instructional (41.3%), and integrated (35.3%) leadership, and two leadership styles in China, namely, transformational (38.6%) and instructional (61.4%) principals. Principals with instructional and integrated leadership had higher student achievements in Germany, whereas only principals with transformational leadership had slightly higher student achievements in China. Moreover, three leadership styles in Germany and two in China showed their relationships with each domain of student achievement. In conclusion, principals in Germany and China had different priorities in leading schools. The differences that principal leadership made on student achievements highlighted the differences in principals’ situational context and leading characteristics between Germany and China. © The Author(s) 2022."

The instructional leadership model refers to the role and the functions of school leadership to employ different management tasks with regards to teaching and learning. Instructional leadership role includes (a) developing mission and goals, (b) managing the educational production function, (c) promoting an academic learning climate, and (d) developing a supportive work environment. Instructional leaders were described as leading from a combination of both expertise and charisma focused primarily on the improvement of student learning outcomes. The monograph, entitled Instructional Leadership and Effective Teaching and Learning and written by Nazmi Xhomara, is dedicated to school instructional leadership as an important factor that influences teaching and learning at school. In the first chapter, the author presents and analyzes educational leadership vs educational management, as well as models of educational leadership and management. The author argues on the importance of different leadership models, such as managerial leadership, transformational leadership, participative leadership, interpersonal leadership, transactional leadership, postmodern leadership, moral leadership, and contingent leadership. Chapters Two, Three, and Four shed light on instructional leadership and teaching and learning, understanding of instructional leadership, the concept and practice of instructional leadership, instructional school leadership and learning environment, attributes of instructional leaders, instructional excellence, instructional leadership time management, effective teaching and teachers, as well as teaching challenges and learning environment. Meanwhile, the author has analyzed constructivism, student intelligence, understanding of supervision, instructional collegial supervision, supervision approaches, understanding of evaluation of teaching and learning, teacher evaluation, and instructional observing instruments in chapters Five, Six, and Seven. Chapters Eight and Nine are focused especially on the research work of the relationships between instructional leadership and teaching, learning, and students' achievements, as well as on an empirical study designed and conducted in Albania as a case. Chapters Ten and Eleven are dedicated to instructional leadership preparation and the future of instructional leadership. As a conclusion, Xhomara indicates that principals are responsible for developing school climates and cultures that support the very best instructional practices. The new era of instructional leadership has predictably placed significant demands for accountability for student success and equity on the principal as well as for the university programs that prepare them. Working in twenty-first-century schools, the instructional leader is held more accountable than ever for student success. © 2021 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc. All rights reserved."

Based on theory and job analysis, we observed the effects of five leaders' competencies (achievement orientation, problem analysis and problem solving, social sensitivity, influence, and integrity) on three indicators of effectiveness (perceived leader's effectiveness, leadership emergence, and team performance). Furthermore, we examined whether transformational leadership mediates these effects. We collected the data during an interuniversity student team competition. A total of 57 team leaders and 364 team members participated in the study. At the beginning of the competition, we measured the leaders' competencies through assessment centers. Each leader was assessed by 4 trained assessors in a one day long assessment center consisting of multiple individual and group model situations. After 6 months of teamwork, we measured the perceived leaders' effectiveness, leadership emergence and transformational leadership using questionnaires, and we estimated the teams' performance based on the ranking of the teams in the competition. The results show that leader achievement orientation is a significant predictor of perceived leader effectiveness, leadership emergence and team performance. The other four competencies do not predictieader effectiveness. There is no relation between competencies and transformational leadership; therefore, transformational leadership does not mediate the relation between competencies and effectiveness. The advantages of this study were that we obtained the data regarding the competencies and effectiveness from three different sources and that we measured competencies before the teamwork began. An average of more than 6 subordinates per leader ensures highly reliable evaluations of leaders' transformational leadership, perceived effectiveness and leadership emergence. The results can be applied to leader selection for short-term team projects."

Hence, the current study extended the knowledge by examining the impact of IL and TL on implementing the School Improvement Programme (SIP) in the Ethiopian context designed to foster students’ academic performance. This study randomly sampled and surveyed 2880 public secondary school teachers and 70 principals. The study’s findings suggested that school principals’ personal information, gender, academic qualification, and leadership experience determine their leadership style, the coherence of SIP, and school performance.

The multiple case study included the application of a questionnaire, semi-structured interviews to members of the principal's work team who participated in the study in the three schools, and the consideration of the score obtained by the establishment in a test used for measuring learning outcomes (SIMCE test). Results suggest that in the case of the three schools, transformational leadership has a positive impact on student outcomes. Additionally, unlike what is stated in other studies, transactional leadership is also a key determinant for the achievement obtained by students. Thus, this exploratory research validates the dimensions of the styles of transformational and transactional leadership, contributing to new findings that allow continuing with quantitative larger studies."

This achievement is often defined as positive gains in attendance and test scores as discipline referrals and suspension numbers decrease. Socioeconomic and cultural contributions to student achievement are often relegated to secondary analyses, are used as deficit explanations when achievement is not increased, or are ignored completely. While this approach may give a snapshot of conditions at a given moment, it does not provide program evaluators with enough information to appropriately assess the implementation of interventions. This qualitative study examines the implementation and evaluation of a prosocial intervention in 10 schools serving American Indian families designed to reflect the culture of program participants and community stakeholders. Findings of the study demonstrate that the relationship between leadership and evaluation participants improved as they worked as partners rather than in isolation. Additionally, gains in prosocial student behavior were observed when traditional evaluation methods were suspended for more culturally appropriate methods that allowed for greater collaboration and timely modifications based on emerging research. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC."

Referring to the full range leadership theory (FRLT), we examined the effects of transformational and passive leadership styles of university instructors on students' satisfaction and learning outcomes. Completed web-based questionnaires were obtained from 1270 students who enrolled in large academic courses led by instructors in web-based instructional environments. Data analyses confirmed the validity of the multifactor leadership questionnaire (MLQ) in the virtual asynchronous communication setting with three second-order factors model composed of transformational, active management-by-exception and passive leadership. Leadership styles correlated with student satisfaction: the more the students attributed transformational leadership style to the instructor and the less they attributed a passive leadership style, the more satisfied they were. The attributed leadership style was not related to the actual participation of the students in the virtual discussions or to their academic achievements. The findings suggest that subordinates' satisfaction might be tied more strongly to their perception of the leader than to the actual tangible benefits the leader can provide.

Research Methods: The schools were selected from a geographically stratified sample of public middle schools in a state in the southeastern United States. Multiple linear regression was used to identify schools performing better than expected considering their levels of poverty and other school-related factors. The final three schools, one from each geographic region, showed steady increases in academic achievement and school climate following the arrival of their principals. Data were primarily collected from interviews with principals, teaching and nonteaching staff, and parents using protocols adapted from the International Successful School Principalship Project. Findings: The findings explicate the large degree to which the leadership practices and beliefs that influenced student achievement in these schools were adapted to and commensurate with each school's immediate context. Furthermore, they illustrate how principals used these practices to institutionalize school-wide reform efforts as vehicles for leading change within their schools. Implications: The findings substantiate research on successful school leadership in high-needs middle schools. They also extend this research by examining the way core transformational and instructional leadership practices can be adapted to suit various school contexts and institutionalize school-wide reform efforts to enhance student learning.

The purpose of this paper is to test a model of integrated transformational leadership including three important school mediators. Design/methodology/approach – In total, 5,392 students provided data on student engagement, and 569 teachers provided survey data on principal leadership and the collective teacher efficacy (CTE) and extra effort of their colleagues. Data were analyzed at the school level (n=51) using mediation analysis with the PROCESS macro to calculate the direct and indirect effects of all of the variables in the serial multiple mediator model. Findings – The model explained a significant amount of variance in both reading (38 percent) and mathematics (35 percent). CTE and student engagement mediated all of the leadership effects, demonstrating the importance of teacher and student relations in school improvement. The combined effect sizes are significantly greater than the effects of earlier TL models. Originality/value – This study contributes to “leadership for learning” research by demonstrating that refining transformational leadership behaviors to include instructional management can enhance a leader’s impact on achievement. As one of the few studies to examine student engagement as a mediator along with teacher mediators, the current study highlights the importance of teacher-student relations in school improvement.

Our research reveals a nuanced relationship between varied leadership styles, institutional cultures, and the drive for innovation. Notably, transformational leadership aligns strongly with innovative outcomes and a collaborative institutional ethos, in contrast to the more rigid structures associated with authoritarian and laissez-faire leadership styles. The philosophical core of this inquiry lies in examining how leadership practices embody and promote ethical values that influence collective and individual success. Institutions that cultivate a culture of collaboration and are open to embracing risk are found to be more conducive to innovation. In contrast, settings that emphasize rigid hierarchies and prioritize individual achievement tend to stifle creative and innovative practices. Our findings emphasize the crucial role of leaders in shaping an ethical climate that nurtures innovation. Effective leadership is pivotal in fostering an environment supportive of progressive teaching and management strategies. This includes investing in faculty development, enhancing collaborative efforts, and acknowledging academic excellence. Moreover, the strategic integration of technology and a shift towards student-centred learning are identified as essential for advancing innovative teaching practices. By delving into the philosophical and ethical dimensions of educational leadership, this study contributes to a deeper understanding of how leadership rooted in ethical and collaborative values can profoundly impact educational innovation and success.

Humanistic leadership has been part of Africa since the pre-modern era (i.e., ancient Egypt) through the Maat philosophy. Maat is a philosophy of the people of ancient Kemet or black Egypt. It “is a fundamental, pervasive, and enduring element in ancient Egyptian civilization and an inclusive and defining cultural category” (Karenga, Maât. The moral ideal in ancient Egypt: A study in classical African ethics, Routledge, 2004). Such leadership is particularly significant in this era of the Africa Union Agenda 2063, which views one of the critical success factors for the achievement of the agenda as “leadership and political commitment with transformational and visionary qualities at all levels and in all fields.” This view is also encapsulated in the World Economic Forum which indicates that “Africa doesn’t need charity, it needs good leadership.” In addition, the Mo Ibrahim Foundation, advocates effective leadership in Africa, established an award for good national leaders and a proprietary index that gauges the quality of governance and leadership in African countries (Mo Ibrahim Foundation, Governance progress in Africa stalling, reports Mo Ibrahim, 2015). This award has not been won in eight of the twelve years because no leader has been found worthy of the award. The chapter integrates historical, anthropological, and philosophical accounts of leadership in Africa to situate humanistic leadership in modern Africa. The framework is limited to the period before the colonial eras of Africa (i.e., the Kemetic era). Following a brief review of extant leadership in Africa, I discuss the Maatian view of humanistic leadership. Leveraging that historical perspective, I discuss exemplars of humanistic leaders in modern Africa. Three such leaders are Nelson Mandela (Glad and Blanton, Presidential Studies Quarterly 27:565–590, 1997; Pietersen, Leader to Leader 2015:60–66, 2015), Desmond Tutu (Blankstein et al., Excellence through equity: Five principles of courageous leadership to guide achievement for every student. ASCD, 2016), James Mwangi of Equity Bank of Kenya (Chironga et al., Leadership lessons from Africa’s trailblazers. McKinsey Quarterly, 1–10, 2019). While Nelson Mandela and Desmond Tutu epitomize the Ubuntu principles of humanism, James Nwangi exemplifies the Maatian humanistic principles. Both the traditional or ancient view of humanistic leadership which is illustrated with modern leaders affords an opportunity for scholars conducting research on humanistic leadership in Africa to ground their studies in Indigenous philosophical and humanistic principles. Humanistic leadership is proposed as a function of decisions and actions of African traditional orientations that derive from Maat philosophy. This perspective unearths the source of modern understanding of humanistic leadership and reorients the field of leadership development and prevention of bad leadership as they relate to management of organizations in Africa. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024."

This study is a qualitative study with an interactive analysis model on transformational leadership strategies at the international Madrasah Aliyah Amanatul Ummah Mojokerto and the Serpong Insan Cendekia State Madrasah Aliyah. This study concluded that the first strategy to increase the influence of the idealism of the madrasah principal towards an international pesantren-based Madrasah Aliyah is the strong commitment between the principal and teachers, employees, students, as well as parents, beginning with planning (RKM) using school review, quality assurance, benchmarking, and quality control accompanied by exemplary values, an effort to maintain mutual trust as well as the sincerity of all stakeholders. Then, the second strategy is to foster inspirational motivation for the principals of international pesantren-based Madrasah Aliyah which is reflected in the ability of madrasah principals who can motivate and inspire their subordinates to improve the quality of education together. For example, the achievement of madrasah principals, teachers and students winning the international olympiad between 2010-2020 is supported by the principle of Islamic boarding school that is ‘The Islamic Role Model is The First Key to Build Great Leaders’. Furthermore, The third strategy is to strengthen the intellectual stimulus of Madrasah Aliyah’s principal with superior international standards based on Islamic boarding school values, which is reflected in several positive changes made and achieved by the madrasah’s principal, both the quality of the input, process, and output, such as student achievements in national and international levels such as scholarships to the Middle East, Europe, Japan, and Australia. Finally, the last strategy is to transform the madrasah principal’s individualized considereation towards superior international pesantren-based Madrasah Aliyah which is reflected in the ability of madrasah principals in managing human resources appropriately, including managing the right competencies for human resources through the competency development programs for teachers and employees continuously; and improving abilities through training supported by the principles of responsibility and exemplary, which are the characteristics of pesantren. © 2021"

Australian early childhood education and care (ECEC) has its roots in philanthropic and educational reform movements prevalent at the turn of the twentieth century. More recently, with the introduction of the National Early Childhood Reform Agenda, early childhood education has once more been linked to the achievement of aims associated with redressing inequality and disadvantage. The authors argue that educational leaders have an obligation to promote equity as they articulate the needs of marginalised students who are traditionally disadvantaged while they also work towards challenging the social order that affords this circumstance of inequity to exist. Drawing on extant literature, including data from two previously reported Australian studies in which leadership emerged as having a transformational impact on service delivery, this article examines the potential of early childhood leadership to generate 'socially just' educational communities. With reference to critical theory, the authors argue that critically informed, intentional and strategic organisational leadership can play a pivotal role in creating changed circumstances and opportunities for children and families. Such leadership includes positional and distributed elements, articulation of values and beliefs, and collective action that is mindful and informed."

As a result, researchers seldom explore how well their models predict the outcomes they care about using best-practice approaches to predictive statistics. In this paper, we focus less on explanation and more on prediction, showing how both are important for advancing the field. We apply predictive models to the role of teachers on student engagement, i.e. the thoughts, attitudes, and behaviours, that translate motivation into progress. We integrate the suggestions from four prominent motivational theories (self-determination theory, achievement goal theory, growth mindset theory, and transformational leadership theory), and aim to identify those most critical behaviours for predicting changes in students’ engagement in physical education. Students (N = 1324 all from year 7, 52% girls) from 17 low socio-economic status schools rated their teacher’s demonstration of 71 behaviours in the middle of the school year. We also assessed students’ engagement at the beginning and end of the year. We trained elastic-net regression models on 70% of the data and then assessed their predictive validity on the held-out data (30%). The models showed that teacher behaviours predicted 4.39% of the variance in students’ change in engagement. Some behaviours that were most consistently associated with a positive change in engagement were being good role models (β = 0.046), taking interest in students’ lives outside of class (β = 0.033), and allowing students to make choices (β = 0.029). The influential behaviours did not neatly fit within any single motivational theory. These findings support arguments for integrating different theoretical approaches, and suggest practitioners may want to consider multiple theories when designing interventions. More generally, we argue that researchers in educational psychology should more frequently test how well their models not just explain, but predict the outcomes they care about. © 2023, Crown."

The literature review discusses aspects of leadership theory to elucidate understanding of how leadership influences teachers’ working relationships. Quantitative methodology and analyses ascertain the correlation between Leithwood et al.’s dimensions of transformational leadership and the author’s dimensions of teacher social capital. Study findings indicate significant, positive moderate to high moderate correlations between: (1) transformational leadership and the environmental conditions nurturing teacher social capital; (2) leadership and teacher social capital; and (3) leadership and teacher collective efficacy (TCE). An additional major finding is the perception of higher levels of transformational leadership among teachers in middle performing and high performing schools as compared to the perceptions of teachers in low performing schools. This study provides evidence of the importance of transformational leadership in the development of teacher social capital within a school. High levels of teacher social capital should result in positive outcomes of student achievement, teacher quality and teacher job satisfaction. The study findings, interpretations and conclusions contribute to both school leadership and school improvement literature and should inform discussions about leadership development and the impact of leadership on teacher working relationships. © 2013, SAGE Publications.

Case overview/synopsis: In “Cultural Collisions: The Struggle for Recognition in a Cross-Cultural Workplace,” Alex Brown, the National Marketing Head at ShowVista, faces mounting frustration as his contributions to the company’s success go unrecognized. Despite spearheading innovative marketing strategies that boosted revenue, Brown finds himself sidelined in an organization where hierarchy, consensus-driven decision-making and relationship-based leadership take precedence over individual achievement. ShowVista’s Indian-influenced corporate culture clashes with Brown’s results-oriented, recognition-driven mindset, leaving him isolated and undervalued. His attempts to implement data-driven approaches are met with resistance, while credit for his successes is often attributed to senior executives. The strain of navigating an unfamiliar work culture, compounded by personal sacrifices, forces Brown to question his future at the company. As he stands at a crossroads, he must decide whether to adapt to ShowVista’s norms or seek an organization that aligns with his values. The case examines the complexities of cultural fit, leadership role in a multicultural organization and career identity in a global workplace.

The study sought to measure leadership dimensions based on microdata from contextual questionnaires answered by principals and teachers; propose a model that relates leadership dimensions to student achievement as reflected by schools’ IDEB results; and verify the relationships between leadership dimensions and student achievement. To that end, we performed multivariate analyzes, specifically structural equations modeling, on a database containing microdata from Prova Brasil and IDEB values. Results show that it is possible to measure leadership dimensions using these microdata. Based on the conceptual model developed, there is evidence that the relationships developed by the principal within the school have a greater effect on teachers’ commitment to improve teaching and learning, thus indirectly affecting school performance. In addition, school principals have sought to exercise transformational leadership combined with pedagogical leadership, which represents a challenge for them, since it covers many knowledge areas. © 2019, Arizona State University.

It creates problems for schools, which eventually leads to substandard instruction and low student achievement. This research explores the causes of English teachers’ turnover in a Non-Government Educational Organization in Kabul, Afghanistan. The results indicate that lack of teachers’ motivation, low salary, communication gap between management and teachers, market opportunities for English teachers, workload, absence of career path and weak recruitment processes are the major factors contributing to teachers’ turnover in Afghanistan. The high teachers’ turnover leads to such negative effects as interruptions in learning process, behavioural adjustment of students with new teachers, continuous exposure of students with novice teachers, emotional detachments of students with their teachers and negative effects on students’ learning. The article concludes that educational organizations should deal with their teachers more humanely. Teachers retain and perform in an organization when they are valued, motivated and satisfied with their jobs and their professional status. In the absence of such environment, it is likely that educational organizations in Afghanistan would continue to struggle to attract and retain qualified teachers, which will eventually compromise on the achievements of their students. Considering the findings, creation of covenantal bond rather than contractual bond is suggested as a strategy that could be augmented by a transformational leadership, which can motivate the teachers to remain committed to their profession. © The Author(s) 2015."

The impact of school leadership may be even more pronounced in charter schools. Due to current and unprecedented growth, unique design, and complexities of political, financial, and governance issues they face, there is a need for more highly qualified charter school leaders and perhaps even “differently” prepared leaders. In this qualitative study, the authors documented the characteristics and skills of two successful, sustained charter school leaders who retrospectively described their evolved and evolving roles over twenty five years. Each transformed high-poverty, low-performing schools with at-risk populations and led with vision, passion, and a relentless desire to positively influence their organizations and ultimately improve student success in their communities. Although many of their skills and characteristics fall within existing theories, such as situational leadership, transformational leadership, and distributive leadership, they embodied a level of dedication and commitment to the original communities in which they founded charters lasting over a quarter of a century. The findings suggest that founding a charter school and seeing it through to success over time may more closely resemble missionary work than traditional school leadership. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis."

Model testing employed a latent variables partial least squares path analysis procedure.Findings The results of research have shown that leadership characteristics of a school are important factors in promoting systems and structures that enable the school to be effective and improve, in brief, to operate as a learning organization. School leaders need to be skilled in transformational leadership practices which work, directly and indirectly through others, towards bringing about: consensus in the organization's mission; structures for shared decision making; continual learning through reflective practice; high standards of professionalism; and, a supportive and appreciative climate that promotes a culture of trust and collaboration. The LOLSO research also demonstrates that schools can be identified as learning organizations as they establish sequentially systems and structures of operation that promote: a collaborative and trusting work environment; a shared and monitored mission; empowerment of its members to share decision-making, show initiative and take risks; and, on-going challenging and relevant professional development. These school factors of leadership and organizational learning are shown to influence what happens in the core business of the school; the teaching and learning.Value The article answers two fundamental questions: Does the nature of the leadership and the level of organizational learning in schools contribute to school effectiveness and improvement in terms of the extent of students' participation in school, student academic self-concept and engagement with school?

Yet, the implementation of school-wide interventions is complex and can be psychologically taxing for implementing personnel. If evidence-based practice and program (EBP) implementation goes unsupported, implementation challenges might result in chronic stress among school personnel that leads to burnout. While generally effective leadership tends to decrease educator burnout, implementation-specific leadership may also decrease burnout through its strategic supports for EBP implementation. A series of linear regression and path models were used to examine the concurrent association between transformational (e.g., general) and implementation (e.g., strategic) leadership and burnout and its component parts (i.e., emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, personal accomplishment). In a sample of 338 school personnel, we found transformational and implementation leadership were each significantly associated with decreased burnout. However, transformational leadership was not significantly associated with any of the three burnout components, whereas implementation leadership was significantly associated with increased personal accomplishment. These results suggest both general and strategic forms of leadership are key supports for school personnel burnout and as such, leaders may benefit from training to improve each.

Design/methodology/approach: A case study approach involving mixed methods including semi-structured interviews and document analysis was used within three purposively sampled schools to examine implementation success factors relevant to instructional leadership literature Findings: The case studies reveal the overall value of the Kiribati instructional leadership program involving school leader workshops and ongoing coaching support, with instructional leadership reflecting directive and collaborative, as well as transformative theoretical aspects. Key implementation success factors within researched schools were leaders undertaking regular observations in classrooms, systematic tracking of student achievement and nurturing a positive culture for learning, as well as establishment of various collaborative processes involving community and teacher peer learning groups. Research limitations/implications: The study provides in-depth information through teacher and school leader interviews and examining relevant school documentation artefacts. A limitation is that the study involved only three schools and was undertaken less than a year into program implementation. Future research involving more schools and several years after implementation would be beneficial to investigate sustainability across the school system and longer-term program impacts.

But for change to take place we must consider the role leadership plays in the innovation of change. Leaders, deans and department heads must be an integral part of this process. The challenge for innovation, change and education technology leaders is to transform teacher preparation programs into fully realized TPACK environments and determine the necessary learning opportunities and support necessary to motivate college leaders and faculty to fully embrace the change process. This article outlines a collaborative ongoing process and blueprint that leaders should consider as they make plans for the effective integration of TPACK into their colleges. ""Tomorrow's teachers must be prepared to rethink, unlearn and relearn, change, revise, and adapt"" (Niess, 2008, p.225). Leaders, deans and department heads must be an integral part of this process if it is to be successful.While technology can support changes in how teacher educators teach and future teachers learn to teach (Dilworth et al., 2012), teaching with technology is a ""wicked problem"" in that it has ""incomplete, contradictory and changing requirements"" (Koehler & Mishra, 2008, p.10). New and innovative ways of confronting this complexity must address core knowledge base components that include content, pedagogy, and technology. These components have been used as the foundation for a technology,pedagogy, andcontent knowledge(TPACK) framework known as technological pedagogical content knowledge, or TPCK (AACTE, 2008; Koehler & Mishra, 2008; Mishra & Koehler, 2006; Pierson, 1999). But what is the role of leaders where TPACK based processes are being implemented in university teacher preparation programs?Educational technology leaders often approach models for teacher preparation in collectives that examine them iteratively. The 2012 National Technology Leadership Summit brought together the American Association of Colleges for Teacher Education (AACTE) and its Innovation and Technology Committee. Representatives from college administrations met and examined leadership issues facing deans, directors and chairs as they work to support college-wide change facilitating faculty and teacher candidates in the task of becoming TPACK proficient. This work built upon a CITE (Contemporary Issues in Technology and Teacher Education) journal editorial focused on initial conversations around leadership needs for effective TPACK implementation (Dexter, Herring, & Thomas, 2012). A presentation at AACTE 2013 extended this work with teacher preparation and education technology leaders sharing ""what worked"" in their colleges around these processes. A panel presentation at the 2013 Society for Information Technology and Teacher Education (SITE) Conference also shared insights into a blueprint for key areas that leaders should consider as they make plans for the effective integration of TPACK into their colleges as well as several implementation case studies. This article compiles this iterative work from a leadership perspective.While the challenge is to transform teacher preparation programs into fully realized TPACK environments, leadership becomes the key in developing new ways of confronting this complex issue that must address core knowledge base components inclusive of content, pedagogy and technology. To accomplish this task, faculty are faced with incorporating modeling these ideas within a teacher education curriculum in concert with ongoing change processes. A solid understanding of the interactions of these components can result in effective teaching with technology in varied and diverse settings; but the critical role of leadership in making such changes must first be considered.The critical features of a blueprint for leaders is based upon the work of Leithwood and colleagues' framework comprised of three key leadership functions associated with improved student outcomes (Day, Sammons, Leithwood, Kington, 2008; Leithwood, Harris & Hopkins, 2008; Leithwood & Jantzi, 2008; Leithwood & Riehl, 2003). The three major component of the Leithwood transformational leadership model are: (1) Building vision and setting direction (2) Developing people through understanding people and (3) Developing the organization through redesigning it.Leithwood, Begley and Cousins (1994) define transformational leadership as follows:The term 'transform' implies major changes in the form, nature, function and/or potential of some phenomenon; applied to leadership, it specifies general ends to be pursued although it is largely mute with respect to means. From this beginning, we consider the central purpose of transformational leadership to be the enhancement of the individual and collective problem-solving capacities of organizational members; such capacities are exercised in the identification of goals to be achieved and practices to be used in their achievement (p. 7).Transformational leaders can create significant change in both followers and the organization with which they are associated (Griffin, 2003). Transformational leaders also find common ground that allows them to enlist followers in processes of change. Fullan (2010) finds that for true reform to take place, resolute leadership that remains focused is critical when new ideas encounter serious difficulty, thereby sustaining and building on success.To achieve this task and create significant change, transformational education leaders realize that true technology integration means understanding and negotiating the relationships between the three components of knowledge and going beyond a ""business"" organizational model to create change in teacher preparation programs. Too often organizations start down the road to change without being clear on key factors that influence the outcomes of the initiative. Deans and educational leaders must develop a model for change based upon both the organizational culture and the environments they need a set of resources to help and guide them to integrate a framework like TPACK. Through ongoing collaboration and discussion the focus has been around the development of a leadership module which would help leaders establish a vision and set a direction for addressing TPACK. The purpose of a leadership module would be to provide Deans and other educational leaders with the tools they need for full-scale implementation and motivate them to redesign their programs while continuing to improve and sustain a developing / changing curriculum. © 2013 Association for Educational Communications and Technology."

Transactional leadership consists of planning, implementation, and evaluation. Transformational leadership consists of charisma, intellectual stimulation, and individualized consideration that can motivate followers. The six orientations that characterize the Catholic healthcare ministry imply both types of leadership. Fundamental values, knowledge, and skills required for healthcare organization management are acquired through health administration education. The themes prevalent in today's Catholic healthcare ministry and the leadership qualities they imply are addressed by all aspects of such education: degree programs, field experience, continuing education, and research and consultation. Much of a master's degree program concentrates on transactional leadership because its content is better formulated and easier to teach. The development of transformational leadership qualities during master's study primarily provides a foundation on which students can build. Health administration programs in cooperation with healthcare organizations have created three models for field experience: internships, residencies, and fellowships. Many master's programs deliver continuing education programs for both types of leadership, and research and consultation contribute to this education."

Design A large survey based on questionnaires developed from non-school organizations was used to develop a model to test the nature and strength of the relationships between variables and to understand the interactive nature of leadership and organizational learning and their effects on student outcomes. Model testing employed a latent variables partial least squares path analysis procedure. Findings The results of research have shown that leadership characteristics of a school are important factors in promoting systems and structures that enable the school to be effective and improve, in brief, to operate as a learning organization. School leaders need to be skilled in transformational leadership practices which work, directly and indirectly through others, towards bringing about: consensus in the organization’s mission; structures for shared decision making; continual learning through reflective practice; high standards of professionalism; and, a supportive and appreciative climate that promotes a culture of trust and collaboration. The LOLSO research also demonstrates that schools can be identified as learning organizations as they establish sequentially systems and structures of operation that promote: a collaborative and trusting work environment; a shared and monitored mission; empowerment of its members to share decision-making, show initiative and take risks; and, on-going challenging and relevant professional development. These school factors of leadership and organizational learning are shown to influence what happens in the core business of the school; the teaching and learning. Value The article answers two fundamental questions: Does the nature of the leadership and the level of organizational learning in schools contribute to school effectiveness and improvement in terms of the extent of students’ participation in school, student academic self-concept and engagement with school?

Research Design: The methodology involved an analysis of findings from 27 published studies of the relationship between leadership and student outcomes. The first meta-analysis, including 22 of the 27 studies, involved a comparison of the effects of transformational and instructional leadership on student outcomes. The second meta-analysis involved a comparison of the effects of five inductively derived sets of leadership practices on student outcomes. Twelve of the studies contributed to this second analysis. Findings: The first meta-analysis indicated that the average effect of instructional leadership on student outcomes was three to four times that of transformational leadership. Inspection of the survey items used to measure school leadership revealed five sets of leadership practices or dimensions: establishing goals and expectations; resourcing strategically; planning, coordinating, and evaluating teaching and the curriculum; promoting and participating in teacher learning and development, and ensuring an orderly and supportive environment. The second meta-analysis revealed strong average effects for the leadership dimension involving promoting and participating in teacher learning and development and moderate effects for the dimensions concerned with goal setting and planning, coordinating, and evaluating teaching and the curriculum. Conclusions and Implications for Research and Practice: The comparisons between transformational and instructional leadership and between the five leadership dimensions suggested that the more leaders focus their relationships, their work, and their learning on the core business of teaching and learning, the greater their influence on student outcomes. The article concludes with a discussion of the need for leadership research and practice to be more closely linked to the evidence on effective teaching and effective teacher learning.

Method: The sample of this study consisted of 2,595 students nested in 52 schools and 125 classes from the French-speaking community of Belgium. Students performed two mathematics achievement tests and answered a self-reported questionnaire on their backgrounds. All the teachers (n = 817) of the 52 schools answered a self-reported questionnaire dealing with the principal's leadership, school culture, and teacher collegiality. Hypotheses are tested using correlation, regression, and hierarchical regression analyses. Research Findings: First, it was found that culture homogeneity is positively associated with (a) the principal's transformational leadership (TL) and (b) the teachers' collective decision making relative to pedagogical aspects. Second, it was shown that the impact of TL on culture homogeneity is partially mediated by teachers' collective decision making. Third, the analyses found no moderation effect of culture homogeneity on the relationship between cultural values and students' achievement but did show partial evidence of such an effect in specific groups of schools (with low or high socioeconomic status composition).

This study examined the practices of administrators in each of 12 schools which had developed highly collaborative professional relationships over a three year period in the context of school improvement initiatives. Results suggest the feasibility of developing more collaborative school cultures in a relatively brief period of time and clarify the role played by the larger context of school improvement for fostering collaboration. Specific strategies used by the administrators are described. These strategies are associated with a concept of leadership termed “transformational”. © 1990, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Interviews with staff and students, together with classroom observation, confirm that the head, appointed in 1995, has played an important role in transforming internal processes and in changing the context of the school. Although the observed and reported behaviour of leaders, teachers, and students matches expectations from the literature, the consequences for student achievement are unclear. Background variables seem to explain most of the apparent improvement in student outcomes. An effectiveness framework that assigns disproportionate value to examination results seems to have created a leadership paradox, where heads reported to be transformational produce only limited gains in performance. The study concludes that the government's determination to assume a strongly positive relationship between leaders and outcomes has compromised the principle of evidence-informed policy-making and that we need a different approach based on a broadly defined, qualitative conception of student success."

Adherence to inspectional and faultfinding supervision under the guise of standards-based and other practices has serious consequences for the improvement of teaching and student achievement. Unless those of us who are committed to the study of supervision in higher education, as well as school administrators and other practitioners who supervise teachers, are ready, willing and able to assert responsibilities for best practice in supervision through transformational leadership the educational landscape will remain in its transitory and vulnerable state, inconsequential at best, destructive at worst. Relying on the social and educational critiques of Robert Goldhammer and Jules Henry, this article seeks to raise the consciousness of those committed to instructional excellence by offering insights into ways supervision can serve to enhance teachers' dignity, impact student learning and transform our work, and even schools themselves, so that vulnerability turns into possibilities and stagnation into transformation."

Path analysis of data from 205 elementary schools supported this hypothesis. Schools with higher levels of transformational leadership had higher collective teacher efficacy, greater teacher commitment to school mission, school community, and school-community partnerships, and higher student achievement. Increasing the transformational leadership practices in schools makes a small but practically important contribution to overall student achievement."

Studies conducted elsewhere in the world found that effective school leadership is needed for the success of professional development programmes. The purpose of this paper is to explore principals’ lived experiences with regard to their roles in the implementation of the English Language Proficiency Programme (ELPP). Design/methodology/approach: This paper followed a qualitative inquiry with multiple case study designs to explore principals’ lived experiences during the implementation of the ELPP. Ten schools were selected for the analysis, two from each of the five regions. The schools were selected on the basis of remoteness, the total number of teachers who participated in the ELPP, school phases (i.e. primary and combined) and pre-test scores. Principals were interviewed using exploratory open-ended questions, and data analysis produced five categories under which the results were presented. Findings: The findings indicate that principals applied their individual logic to accommodate and implement the programme. They applied their individual productive leadership habitus to contextualise ELPP activities to ease their workload and appear corporative. Principals had significant influence on teacher learning and ensured successful implementation of a ministerial programme. Moreover, their leadership skills influenced the ways in which teachers received instruction and created a conducive learning environment. Owing to principals’ administrative, instructional and transformational leadership, many teachers participated and transcended upward and some were declared proficient in English. Research limitations/implications: This study research the effectiveness of leadership regarding English professional development programmes in achieving goals, explore power relations between school principals and education officials when developing and implementing professional development programmes and establish more efficient ways of providing a better leadership model for professional development programmes to achieve goals. Practical implications: This paper was limited to a few principals at rural schools in selected regions, therefore findings could not be generalised. Social implications: There is a need for creating opportunities for interactions among all stakeholders who are involved in the development and implementation of English proficiency programmes and to build power relations and work as a team to benefit schools. In order to enhance programme implementation and improve learning outcomes, there is also a need to provide feedback at intervals and find solutions to challenges as a team. Originality/value: Placing principals in situations without orientation triggered the need for specific leadership logic and particularities to be applied in a context for the success of the programme, which resulted in participation of more teachers in the ELPP. They applied their particularities and productive habitus through administrative, instructional and transformational leadership to enhance learning. Principals appointed English language teachers to instruct and mentor others, and consequently enabled some principals and teachers to exit the programme. Principals achieved these short wins upon realising that one has to cooperate with the authority to ensure achieving desired outcomes. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."

The aim of the present investigation was to explore the synergistic impacts of principal's leadership approaches and teacher motivation on performance among high school teachers from three schools in Banjarmasin City, Indonesia. A qualitative research framework was adopted, which entailed the utilization of purposive sampling technique, semi-structured interviews, and thematic analysis to collect and analyze data. The findings suggest that in the selected institutions, principals have a direct influence on teacher motivation through the provision of supportive governance. In addition, school leadership indirectly shapes teacher performance through lobbying for equitable pay for their subordinates and ensuring access to teaching resources, which in turn influence teacher motivation levels. The findings through quantitative technique indicate a significant and positive influence of transformational leadership on teacher performance. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."

This is a descriptive and correlational study which was carried out on 103 principals of high school (51 females and 52 males). Sampling method included stratified sampling proportional to the size and simple random sampling. To collect the data, Bass and Avolio's Transformational Leadership and principal's psychological empowerment of Spreitzer were used. Analysis of survey data was done by calculating frequencies, percentages, means, standard deviations, correlation coefficient test and stepwise regression coefficient test. The results showed that among a series of seven transformational leadership factors except for leadership that is based on non-interference which is used at an average level, the principals use other factors including: inspirational motivation, idealized influence, intellectual stimulation, contingent reward, personal considerations and management by exception at a high level, respectively. In the case of psychological empowerment variable, the mean scores of principals at all dimensions were placed in the range of high. In this regard, the dimensions of meaning and concept, ability, job satisfaction, the selection and effect obtained the highest mean, respectively. The results also showed that there was a relatively significant positive relationship between idealized influence and inspirational motivation factors of transformational leadership and all aspects of psychological empowerment. In general, there was a significant relationship between the two variables (r = 0.382). Regression test showed that the two factors of inspirational motivation and idealized influence together could predict 23.4% of changes in the psychological empowerment of principals. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."

This article reports a pretest, posttest study using an intervention and control group to test whether changes to CEST information-processing systems could bring about changes in transformational leadership. The results of a 10-week, individually delivered coaching intervention program with a small group of school principals showed that there was a significant increase in transformational leadership scores between the pretest and posttest for the intervention group, as rated by school staff. The control group remained unchanged. Qualitative results from interviews indicated that school principals in the intervention group became more aware and reflective about their leadership practice.

Principal transformational leadership was not associated directly with either school staff turnover or school-aggregated student achievement progress. Rather, principal transformational leadership showed an indirect effect, through staff job satisfaction, on school staff turnover (negative) and on school-aggregated student achievement progress (positive). Finally, higher levels of school staff job satisfaction were associated with smaller achievement gaps between minority and non-minority students.

This study aimed to identify the latent profiles of head nurses’ ethical competence and examine differences in transformational leadership across latent profiles. Methods: Convenience sampling was used to recruit 329 head nurses from four tertiary hospitals in Changsha, Hunan province, China. This study collected data by using social-demographic survey, Ethical Competence Questionnaire, and Head Nurse’s Transformational Leadership Self-rating Scale between July and August 2023. Latent profile analysis (LPA) was employed to identify latent profiles of ethical competency. One-way ANOVA test and the Kruskal–Wallis test were used to compare the transformational leadership scores across latent profiles of ethical competency. Results: The mean scores of ethical competence and transformational leadership were 4.045 ± 0.394 and 4.555 ± 0.419, respectively. This study identified three latent profiles of head nurses’ ethical competence, and those profiles labelled “low ethical competence” (n = 60, 18.2%), “moderate ethical competence” (n = 217, 66.0%) and “high ethical competence” (n = 52, 15.8%). The average score of transformational leadership was also statistically different (F = 26.446, p = 0.000) across the three profiles. Conclusion: Our findings underscore the importance of tailoring interventions to address the varying profiles of ethical competence among head nurses. Enhancing ethical competence can strengthen transformational leadership, ultimately leading to improved patient outcomes and overall healthcare quality. © The Author(s) 2024."

Therefore, this study explored leadership styles and leadership outcomes of head nurses and directors of nursing (DoN) in nursing homes based on well-defined leadership concepts. Methods: A multicenter cross-sectional analysis was conducted on baseline data of an ongoing cohort study comprising a convenience sample of nursing home staff (n = 302). Leadership styles and leadership outcomes of head nurses and DoN were measured through the rater form of the Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire 5X (MLQ-5X). Based on the Full Range of Leadership Model, the MLQ-5X visualizes transformational (relation and change focused), transactional (task-focused) and passive-avoidant (absence of leadership) leadership styles. Scores of head nurses and DoN for leadership styles and outcomes were compared with European Reference Scores (ERS) using two-sided one-sample t-tests. Results: Compared with ERS, head nurses and DoN scored significantly lower (p < 0.001) on transformational and transactional leadership styles and significantly higher (p < 0.001) on passive-avoidant leadership styles. All leadership outcomes were significantly lower (p < 0.001) for head nurses. Similar results, however not statistically significant, were found concerning leadership outcomes of DoN. Conclusions: Results indicate that passive-avoidant leadership styles are excessively present in contrast to transformational leadership styles in nursing homes.

To achieve effective results, the primary care physicians should have leadership and coordinating skills, especially when dealing with the health challenges in Asia Pacific region. The care coordinator role of primary care physicians is important to create the bridge between population and health. This study aims to determine the correlation between care coordinator performance and leadership factors among primary care physicians. Materials and methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted, and data collection involved a total of 84 primary care physicians who were randomly selected from a total of 44 subdistricts and worked in 40 randomly selected village government-owned primary healthcare facilities in Jakarta. Pearson’s correlation, independent t-test, and one-way ANOVA were used to measure the correlation between care coordination and clinical leadership, transformational leadership, commitment, job satisfaction, and organizational culture, as well as the sociodemographics of the physicians and the professional practice factors. Multiple regressions were conducted to determine the most important factors influencing care coordinator performance. Results: Respondents were mainly female (94%) with an average age of 36 years and were mostly medical doctors without any additional postgraduate degrees (95.2%). There was no correlation between care coordinator scores and organizational culture or commitment. There were positive and significant correlations between care coordinator scores and clinical leadership score (r=0.66; P<0.001), transformational leadership score (r=0.54; P<0.001), job satisfaction score (r=0.31; P=0.004), physician’s age (r=0.34; P=0.002), length of time since graduation (r=0.30; P=0.005), duration of employment at their health center (r=0.33; P=0.003), training in family medicine (P=0.04), and employment status (P=0.005).

A critical question arises: Are prospective teachers adequately prepared to adapt to these evolving demands with the necessary competencies? This study addresses this question by investigating the effectiveness of an Integrated Learning Model (ILM) in enhancing key teaching competencies. The research focuses on teaching skills, analytical thinking abilities, academic integrity, and transformational leadership qualities among prospective teachers. The study employs an experimental research design, utilizing a one-group pre-test-post-test methodology to assess the impact of the ILM on 35 students selected through cluster sampling. Data collection instruments included the TPOG for evaluating teaching skills, the ATSI for assessing analytical thinking, the PAAIS-24 for measuring academic integrity, and the GTLS for gauging transformational leadership abilities. The data analysis involved descriptive statistics, paired samples t-tests, and N-gain score analysis. The results indicate a significant positive effect of the ILM on all measured competencies: teaching skills, analytical thinking skills, academic integrity, and transformational leadership. These findings underscore the ILM's potential as a robust framework for developing the competencies necessary for prospective teachers to meet the challenges of modern education. The study suggests that future research should explore the application of ILM in various social contexts, examine its effectiveness in fostering additional relevant competencies, and compare its outcomes with those of other instructional models.

The lack of clinical leadership is alarming given the detrimental effects on patient safety. The objective of the study was to assess whether a leadership training addressing transactional and transformational leadership enhances leadership skills in residents. Methods: A volunteer sample of 57 residents from postgraduate year one to four was recruited across a range of medical specialties. The residents took part in an interventional controlled trial. The four-week IMPACT leadership training provided specific strategies for leadership in the clinical environment, addressing transactional (e.g. active control, contingent reward) and transformational leadership skills (e.g. appreciation, inspirational motivation). Transactional and transformational leadership skill performance was rated (1) on the Performance Scale by an external evaluator blinded to the study design and (2) self-assessed transformational and transactional leadership skills. Both measures contained items of the Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire, with higher scores indicating greater leadership skills. Results: Both scores were significantly different between the IMPACT group and the control group. In the IMPACT group, the Performance Scale increased 15% in transactional leadership skill performance (2.10 to 2.86) (intervention effect, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.40 to 1.13; p < .001, eta2 = 0.31) and 14% in transformational leadership skill performance (2.26 to 2.94) (intervention effect, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.27 to 1.09; p < .001, eta2 = 0.22). The self-assessed transactional skills revealed a 4% increase (3.83 to 4.03) (intervention effect, 0.20; 95% CI, 0.08 to 0.33; p < .001, eta2 = 0.18) and a 6% increase in transformational leadership skills (3.54 to 3.86) (intervention effect, 0.31; 95% CI, 0.02 to 0.40; p< .001, eta2 = 0.53). Discussion and conclusions: These findings support the use of the transactional and transformational leadership framework for graduate leadership training. Future studies should incorporate time-latent post-tests, evaluating the stability of the behavioral performance increase. © 2017 Saravo et al.

Previous research with school leaders has shown that the rational system and constructive elements of the experiential system have a strong positive relationship with transformational leadership, as outlined in the Full-Range Leadership Theory. This article reports a pretest, posttest study using an intervention and control group to test whether changes to CEST information-processing systems could bring about changes in transformational leadership. The results of a 10-week, individually delivered coaching intervention program with a small group of school principals showed that there was a significant increase in transformational leadership scores between the pretest and posttest for the intervention group, as rated by school staff. The control group remained unchanged. Qualitative results from interviews indicated that school principals in the intervention group became more aware and reflective about their leadership practice.

However, there is a lack of studies in skills improvement for medical representatives in Thailand. Considering the work context, medical representatives have to demonstrate the self-leadership behaviors and transformational leadership behaviors. Therefore, the aims of this study were to develop a self-transformational leadership scale for medical representatives in Thailand and test the psychometric properties. A sequential exploratory mixed method design was implemented to explore the definition of self-transformational leadership of medical representatives in Thailand. Firstly, each in-depth interviews with eleven key informants were conducted. The interview was tape-recorded and transcribed verbatim. A 34-items scale was generated and distributed. The participants were 347 medical representatives in Thailand. The qualitative results showed the definition and four components of self-transformational leadership specific to work context of medical representatives in Thailand that are self-idealized influence, self-inspirational motivation, self-intellectual stimulation, and individualized consideration. The quantitative results showed that the scale developed from the previous phase was statistically appropriate. The goodness-of-fit indices demonstrated that the self-transformational leadership model was consistent with the empirical data (Chi-square = 1465.57, df = 523, p-value =.00, RMSEA =.07, SRMR =.07, NFI =.90) with a Cronbach’s alpha score of.92.

Prelicensure nurses do not often practice these skills in a meaningful way during their undergraduate educational experience. Objectives: This paper describes quantitative pre-post findings from the Kouzes and Posner Student Leadership Practices Inventory to examine students' leadership attributes pre-post engagement in an 18. month undergraduate leadership program. Design: This is a non-experimental convenience study that used a quantitative pre-post survey design collecting data from participants and observers using the 360 Kouzes and Posner Student Leadership Practices Inventory. Settings: A private university in the northeastern region of the United States. Participants: Fourteen junior level nursing students who concurrently participated in a leadership program while concurrently completing their required academic courses for their bachelor's degree in nursing. Methods: Paired sample t-tests were used to determine if there was statistical significance among student participants' and observers' perceptions of specific leadership behaviors and skills of students at the onset (pretest) and at the conclusion (posttest) of the leadership program. Results: Participant and observer scores were positively correlated and statistical significance was identified in several practice areas. Conclusions: It is important to integrate transformation leadership skills into undergraduate curriculum since it supports students' engagement in their own learning and instills foundational knowledge critical to their leadership trajectory. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Design/methodology/approach: Schein's Descriptive Index was used in this study. A total of 1,236 surveys were included in the study. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC, r1) were computed to determine the relationship between the different moderators and requisite managerial characteristics. Factorial analysis and agglomerative hierarchal cluster analysis were used to identify the traits attributed to men, women and managers. Findings: Male respondents continue to gender type the managerial role in favour of men. Both males and managers continue to be viewed as agentic in nature while women are viewed in more androgynous terms by both male and female respondents. Practical implications: This study expands our understanding of how males and females view women, men and managers. Based on the results of this study, the authors would argue that women are better equipped to adopt an androgynous leadership style and to practise transformational leadership. Originality/value: This study looks beyond ICC scores and looks at how each of the traits is linked to men, women and managers. The findings are discussed in terms of how organisations need to look beyond the misfit between women and requisite managerial characteristics and focus on what females can contribute at board level and to management in general. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited."

However, empirical studies have coded vision statements in noncomparable ways. To measure the content of vision statements, the present study demonstrates the application of the motive coding methodology developed by McClelland and Winter. Using two independent samples of vision statements, we further demonstrate the applicability of this methodology by testing for expected relationships between vision statements and individual, unit, and organizational performance. Half of the expected relationships yielded significant results. Nevertheless, motive imagery measures yielded reliable scores, were feasible to apply, and provided relevant measures of vision statement content. This methodology has the potential to allow researchers to test charismatic/transformational leadership theory in new ways and to provide leaders with concrete guidance about the content of their vision statements.

Studies conducted elsewhere in the world found that effective school leadership is needed for the success of professional development programmes. The purpose of this paper is to explore principals’ lived experiences with regard to their roles in the implementation of the English Language Proficiency Programme (ELPP). Design/methodology/approach: This paper followed a qualitative inquiry with multiple case study designs to explore principals’ lived experiences during the implementation of the ELPP. Ten schools were selected for the analysis, two from each of the five regions. The schools were selected on the basis of remoteness, the total number of teachers who participated in the ELPP, school phases (i.e. primary and combined) and pre-test scores. Principals were interviewed using exploratory open-ended questions, and data analysis produced five categories under which the results were presented. Findings: The findings indicate that principals applied their individual logic to accommodate and implement the programme. They applied their individual productive leadership habitus to contextualise ELPP activities to ease their workload and appear corporative. Principals had significant influence on teacher learning and ensured successful implementation of a ministerial programme. Moreover, their leadership skills influenced the ways in which teachers received instruction and created a conducive learning environment. Owing to principals’ administrative, instructional and transformational leadership, many teachers participated and transcended upward and some were declared proficient in English. Research limitations/implications: This study research the effectiveness of leadership regarding English professional development programmes in achieving goals, explore power relations between school principals and education officials when developing and implementing professional development programmes and establish more efficient ways of providing a better leadership model for professional development programmes to achieve goals. Practical implications: This paper was limited to a few principals at rural schools in selected regions, therefore findings could not be generalised. Social implications: There is a need for creating opportunities for interactions among all stakeholders who are involved in the development and implementation of English proficiency programmes and to build power relations and work as a team to benefit schools. In order to enhance programme implementation and improve learning outcomes, there is also a need to provide feedback at intervals and find solutions to challenges as a team. Originality/value: Placing principals in situations without orientation triggered the need for specific leadership logic and particularities to be applied in a context for the success of the programme, which resulted in participation of more teachers in the ELPP. They applied their particularities and productive habitus through administrative, instructional and transformational leadership to enhance learning. Principals appointed English language teachers to instruct and mentor others, and consequently enabled some principals and teachers to exit the programme. Principals achieved these short wins upon realising that one has to cooperate with the authority to ensure achieving desired outcomes. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited."

In previous research higher levels of emotional intelligence have been found to be associated with more transformational leadership; thus the present study also seeks to examine whether higher emotional intelligence makes individuals more receptive to self-efficacy-based leadership training. Design/methodology/approach: The study used an experimental design. Participants were randomly assigned to either a self-efficacy expressive writing condition or a control writing condition. Participants were 118 managers who completed measures of self-efficacy, transformational leadership and emotional intelligence at the start of the study and again completed measures of self-efficacy, and transformational leadership after the intervention. Findings: Managers in the intervention condition showed significantly greater transformational leadership self-efficacy and higher transformational leadership scores than the control group managers at post-test. Further, those higher in emotional intelligence were more responsive to the intervention. Practical implications: The intervention holds promise as a low cost and easy to implement method of facilitating development of transformational leadership. Originality/value: The finding that an intervention aimed at increasing self-efficacy can increase transformational leadership extends previous research on both self-efficacy and transformational leadership. This result suggests that leadership self-efficacy may be an important component of transformational leadership. The finding that individuals higher in emotional intelligence benefited most from the intervention extends previous findings regarding the importance of emotional intelligence in organisational settings.

Cluster variables from both industries included in the analysis are as follows: Idealized influence, inspiring motivation, intellectual stimulation, and individualized consideration are all components of leadership. Theoretical Framework: Due to its apparent efficacy, transformational leadership has received a lot of attention from public sector researchers over the past decade. Successful leaders alter their teams by enlisting their followers' help in effecting change. A transformational leader is one who ""transforms"" their followers by inspiring them to make positive personal and professional shifts. Design / Methodology / Approach:The study is exploratory research design using Quantitative data collected from the Banking and Insurance sector employees. The study uses a well-structured questionnaire using Likert scale items. The sample was chosen on Convenience basis from 5 select public sector Insurance companies and 5 select public sector Insurance companies. 100 Questionnaires each were distributed and 97 valid responses were selected for banking industry and 90 responses from Insurance Industry were selected for the study. Paired t test using SPSS software was utilised for analysing the data in the study. Findings:The findings of the study show that there is significant difference between the leadership styles practices in Banking and Insurance industry. The banking sector employees showed a greater inclination towards transformational leadership with higher mean scores and statistically significant outcomes. Research Implications: Banking and insurance each have their own distinct cultures and management philosophies; as a result, they cannot be studied as a single entity under the umbrella of the BFSI sector. Additional research on the various leadership styles currently in use within the banking and insurance sectors is necessary.

Design/methodology/approach: This research was conducted in South Africa, in a variety of organisations, and by sampling employees across three generations, namely millennials, Generation X and baby boomers. Cross-sectional data were collected with an instrument based on the Pearce leadership typology of leadership styles. After confirming reliability and general factorial validity, mean scores were compared using analyses of variance. Findings/results: The results of the study found practically significant differences between millennial leaders and Generation X leaders in the extent to which they apply empowering and transformational leadership styles, as perceived by their subordinates. In absolute terms, millennial leaders display less leadership behaviour than do those of Generation X, with regard to these leadership approaches. Practical implications: Organisations involved in the development of millennial leaders should be aware that interventions should not blindly align to the stereotypes associated with this generation. Further research is also needed to determine which leadership styles are effective with millennial leaders.

The three academic libraries were chosen based on the fact that two of the universities were residential research-intensive universities and the third was an academic library of a distance learning university. Design/methodology/approach: The study adopted a quantitative approach with a survey design in three academic libraries in the Gauteng province in South Africa in which a close-ended questionnaire yielded quantitative data. The study included 29 academic staff from the rank of assistant librarian to the director from the three academic libraries, as these are the personnel in leadership positions. To code and analyse, quantitative data from a Likert scale, SPSS version 25 was used. Cronbach's alpha was used to evaluate the instrument's reliability on the five constructs used in this study to determine readiness to adopt a transformational leadership style. The overall level of internal consistency exceeded the theoretical minimum of 70 percent. The Shapiro-Wilk test was used to determine the normality of the data and the p values were greater than 0.05 (p > 0.05). Tables have been used to present descriptive and inferential statistics based on data. Findings: Participants expressed favourable opinions about academic libraries' ability to learn from the best practices of others in the profession, with mean scores greater than 3.5 on a 5.0 scale. Participants' perceptions of transformative versus traditional management styles yielded a moderate mean score of 3.0, with moderate mean scores ranging from 2.8 to 3.3. The average score for talent identification and succession planning in academic libraries was 3.5. Perceptions of leadership responsibilities had a mean score of 4.1, with attributes on leadership responsibilities scoring at least 3.5. Perceptions of problems for the next generation of leaders in academic libraries were moderate, with a mean score of 3.2 on a scale of 5.0. Research limitations/implications: Only three of the seven public university libraries in the Gauteng province in South Africa were surveyed in this study. The sample size was reasonably small for generalizations beyond the South African Gauteng province academic libraries. However, it was felt useful for this particular case. A survey of all 26 South African public universities is required to assess transformational leadership traits in academic libraries. Practical implications: Next-generation leaders in South African academic libraries are perceived as not being aggressive in terms of team building, coaching and motivating others. Social implications: In the wake of COVID-19, new leadership traits such as scenario planning are needed for academic libraries. Originality/value: Leadership studies abound in the library and information studies (LIS) profession and they are not new. However, research on transformational leadership in South African libraries is still in its early stages. As a result, this study fills a gap in the literature on transformative leadership in academic libraries in South Africa. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited."

Thus, it is essential to examine the factors associated with clinical competency. Purpose This study was designed to (a) investigate head nurse leadership, staff nurse demographics, and clinical competency; (b) examine the impact of demographics on the clinical competency of staff nurses; (c) analyze the correlation between head nurse leadership and staff nurse clinical competency; and (d) examine the effects of demographics on clinical competency after controlling for the head nurse leadership. Methods A cluster sampling method was used to collect data from 200 staff nurses at a national medical center in Taiwan. Questionnaires were used to gather information on head nurse leadership style and staff nurse clinical competency. Descriptive and inferential statistical analyses were conducted, including Mann-Whitney U test, Kruskal-Wallis test, Spearman's rank correlation coefficient, and multivariate analysis of covariance. Results The average score for transformational leadership style among the head nurses was 2.89, whereas transactional leadership style scored an average of 2.49. The average scores for the components of clinical competency, listed from highest to lowest, were as follows: patient care (3.35), professionalism (3.28), communication skills (3.18), management (2.84), and knowledge (2.73). In addition, statistically significant differences were found in clinical competency based on demographic factors, including age, marital status, educational level, job title, and length of employment. Also, a statistically significant, positive correlation between the head nurse transformational leadership style and nurse clinical competency was found. The main effect of length of employment on the five competency components was statistically significant after controlling for transformational leadership. Furthermore, post hoc analysis of covariance revealed a significant effect of length of employment on patient care, knowledge, communication skills, and management. Conclusions The findings of this study indicate transformational leadership and employment length impact the clinical competency of staff nurses, particularly in terms of patient care, communication skills, management, and knowledge. Providing education and training in leadership and management to current and prospective head nurses may be expected to enhance clinical competency in staff nurses and create a more nurturing work environment. Moreover, targeted training may help current head nurses gain insight into their leadership styles and acquire skills to promote transformational leadership. In addition, leadership development may help equip prospective head nurses with critical competencies before assuming leadership responsibilities.  © Lippincott Williams & Wilkins."

To collect the data, Bass and Avolio's Transformational Leadership and principal's psychological empowerment of Spreitzer were used. Analysis of survey data was done by calculating frequencies, percentages, means, standard deviations, correlation coefficient test and stepwise regression coefficient test. The results showed that among a series of seven transformational leadership factors except for leadership that is based on non-interference which is used at an average level, the principals use other factors including: inspirational motivation, idealized influence, intellectual stimulation, contingent reward, personal considerations and management by exception at a high level, respectively. In the case of psychological empowerment variable, the mean scores of principals at all dimensions were placed in the range of high. In this regard, the dimensions of meaning and concept, ability, job satisfaction, the selection and effect obtained the highest mean, respectively. The results also showed that there was a relatively significant positive relationship between idealized influence and inspirational motivation factors of transformational leadership and all aspects of psychological empowerment. In general, there was a significant relationship between the two variables (r = 0.382). Regression test showed that the two factors of inspirational motivation and idealized influence together could predict 23.4% of changes in the psychological empowerment of principals. © Medwell Journals, 2016."

In order to overcome recognized deficiencies, we developed an affordable knowledge and skills workshop called Essential Trauma Critical Care China (ETCCC). Methods: Pre-course and post-course MCQs were used to test knowledge and simulation scenarios quantified clinical competence. Structured feedback was obtained. To evaluate the effect of ETCCC on staff performance, we analyzed the clinical records and questioned resuscitation team peers for trauma patients requiring resuscitation room intervention in the 10 consecutive patients before and after the workshops. Results: During 2022–2023, five workshops were delivered to participants from six hospitals in two Chinese provinces. Cost per participant did not exceed US$125. Fifty-eight doctors and 37 nurses participated. For all delegates pre-course knowledge scores increased from mean 35% to 70% post-course. 99% (n = 82/83) participants reached the required standard in the post-course written test. Post-course skills tests scores were mean 67% for doctors and 84% for nurses. Nurses demonstrated significant improvements in the rate and quality of trauma history acquisition as well as triage skills after the course (all p < 0.01). Doctors scored significant improvement in the areas of leadership and teamwork, care of cervical spine, circulation assessment and fluid resuscitation (all p < 0.02).

Background: Nurses often lack self-confidence and self-efficacy in leadership roles. There is a need for nurses to take leadership opportunities that serve to advance the nursing profession. Methods: A quasi-experimental pre-test post-test design was used. The sampling method selected professional nursing association (PNA) members. Novice participants completed a pre-assessment and post-assessment Leadership Practice Inventory-Self (LPI-S) survey and attended the ADAPT workshop. Experienced nurse leaders participated as mentors. Both groups completed a satisfaction survey after the workshop. Results: Awareness of nursing leadership behaviours increased. Total mean scores for each subscale on the LPI-S increased but this was not statistically significant. All participants reported satisfaction with the ADAPT workshop. Conclusions: This study offers evidence that the ADAPT model influences leadership behaviours.

Leadership plays an important role, with transformational leadership driving innovation and transactional leadership supporting efficiency. The dominant leadership framework is the Full-Range Leadership Theory (FRLT), which identifies three leadership behaviors: transforma-tional, transactional, and passive avoidant. Organizational structures, following Mintzberg, Pugh and Galbraith, including span of control (SoC), unit grouping, and lateral linkages, significantly influence leadership dynamics. This study examines the impact of structural changes on perceived leadership styles in a Dutch radiotherapy center (RTc) following the implementation of proton therapy, a radical innovation. Patients and Methods: A mixed-method approach combined leadership surveys, with data collected at three time points, before and after structural changes in 2022. The multifactor leadership questionnaire (MLQ) was distributed among the employees in November 2021, March 2022, and March 2023. Three interventions were introduced: (1) appointing dedicated team leaders (TLs) to improve information flow and reduce management SoC; (2) integrating a Patient Care (PC) manager into the advisory board to facilitate direct communication within the governance structure, including other hierarchical layers; and (3) adding a proton therapy manager as a liaison to improve coordination. Leadership perceptions were measured using the Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire (MLQ) at three time points (T1, T2, T3). The Independent-Samples Mann–Whitney U-Test (p<0.05), was used to compare T1, T2, and T3, managers’ self-ratings with employee ratings, and scores between photon and proton treatment employees. Results: Transformational leadership significantly increased across all groups, with PC scores rising from 2.3 at T1/T2 to 2.5 at T3, and MT-PC scores from 1.8 at T1 to 2.4 at T3. Passive avoidant leadership significantly decreased (eg, MT-PC: 1.6 at T1 to 1.0 at T3). Transactional leadership showed less pronounced and non-significant changes. Photon therapy staff experienced earlier improvements in leadership perceptions, while proton therapy staff showed delayed but stronger shifts by T3. Conclusion: In this study, structural changes positively influenced leadership perceptions, supporting ambidexterity. Significant increases in transformational leadership and decreases in passive avoidant leadership align leadership styles with the dual demands of innovation and operational efficiency, demonstrating the importance of organizational design in healthcare leadership. Our findings show that healthcare management could use organizational structure changes to promote transformational leadership. © 2025 Swart et al.

The Utrecht Work Engagement Scale (UWES-9) was used to measure nurses’ work engagement. The data were analyzed using statistical tests, the Pearson correlation coefficient, and linear regression analysis. Among the work engagement subscales, nurses scored highest on dedication to work (mean 4.14, SD 1.22) and lowest on vigor (mean 3.68, SD 1.9). For transformational leadership subscales, giving feedback and rewards received the lowest scores (mean of 2.64, SD 1.02), while management of the nursing process scored the highest (mean 3.25, SD 0.92). The correlation between transformational leadership and work engagement was statistically significant (r = 0.367, p < 0.001).

In an extensive literature review, numerous studies were found examining the concept of CT in students and no studies were found exploring CT in nurse managers. Identifying the attributes, such as CT, that lead to success in the nurse manager role is useful when preparing nurse managers to lead effectively in the current healthcare climate. Research Question: Is there a difference between nurse managers' CT dispositions and their respective staff nurses' perceptions of the practice environment?. Design: A convenience sample of 12 nurse managers and a random sample of 132 of their respective staff registered nurses (RNs) participated in this descriptive study. CT in nurse managers was measured by the California Critical Thinking Disposition Inventory (CCTDI). Staff RNs' perceptions of the practice environment were measured by the Practice Environment Scale (PES). The research question was answered using a t test. Findings: Significant (p < .001) differences were found between specific nurse managers' CCTDI scores for open-mindedness, analyticity, and critical thinking confidence, and significant differences (p < .01) were found for systematicity when compared with their respective staff RNs' mean subscale and overall PES scores. Conclusions: Results of the study support the positive relationship between strength in critical thinking dispositions of nurse managers and their respective staff RNs' perceptions of the practice environment. Nurse managers with stronger CT dispositions may be better able to create positive practice environments that are conducive to job satisfaction and thus the retention of staff RNs. Inclusion of strategies to support the development and use of CT in nurse managers is recommended. CT and other leadership attributes and skills including emotional and social intelligence and management of change through an appreciative inquiry process may provide opportunities to improve leadership effectiveness in nurse managers. Clinical Relevance: Enhancing critical thinking skills and dispositions of nurse managers may help to create positive work environments for staff RNs.

Conclusions: The shortened core TL seems to be a valid instrument for research and training purposes in the context of TL and depressive symptoms in employees. Of particular note, men reporting poor TL were more likely to report depressive symptoms. Copyright © 2019 The Korean Society for Preventive Medicine"

However, research on the measurement of leadership development in a virtual work environment for leaders in e-commerce businesses in Thailand is limited. Thus, the main purposes of this study were to examine the dimensions and to develop the scale of virtual transformational leadership for leaders in e-commerce businesses and test its psychometric properties. A multi-methods design was implemented to examine the dimensions and develop the virtual transformational leadership scale for leaders in e-commerce businesses. Firstly, the integration of virtual leadership and transformational leadership behaviors and interviewed with five e-commerce experts were conducted to synthesize the virtual transformational leadership dimensions for leaders in e-commerce businesses. The final 33-item scale of virtual transformational leadership for leaders in e-commerce businesses was generated and distributed as a second result. Data was collected using an online questionnaire, and the instruments used were Likert-type scales. The participants were 600 leaders in e-commerce businesses in Bangkok. The goodness-of-fit indices showed that the virtual transformational leadership model was consistent with the empirical data (Chi-square = 2314.71, df = 585, p-value = .00, RMSEA = .07, SRMR = .04, NFI = .97) with a Cronbach’s alpha score of .96.

This research was undertaken as part of a Hybrid International Emergency Medicine Fellowship programme (Subedi et al., 2020) across UK and Nepal, incorporating a two-year rotation through the UK National Health Service, via the Medical Training Initiative (MTI) (AoMRC, 2017). The WHO TCC can improve outcomes for trauma patients (Lashoher et al., 2016); however, significant barriers affect its implementation worldwide (Nolan et al., 2014; Wild et al., 2020). This article reports on the implementation, barriers and recommendations of WHO TCC implementation in the context of Nepal and argues for Transformational Leadership (TL) to support its implementation. Design/methodology/approach: Explanatory mixed methods research (Creswell, 2014), comprising quasi-experimental research and a qualitative online survey, were selected methods for this research. A training module was designed and implemented for 10 doctors and 15 nurses from a total of 76 (33%) of clinicians to aid in the introduction of the WHO TCC in an emergency department in a hospital in Nepal. The quasi-experimental research involved a pre- and post-training survey aimed to assess participant’s knowledge of the WHO TCC before and after training and before the implementation of the WHO TCC in the emergency department. Post-training, 219 patients were reviewed after four weeks to identify if process measures had improved the quality of care to trauma patients. Subsequently six months later, a qualitative online survey was sent to all clinical staff in the department to identify barriers to implementation, with a response rate of 26 (n = 26) (34%) (20 doctors and 6 nurses). Descriptive statistics were used to evaluate quantitative data and the qualitative data were analysed using the five stepped approach of thematic analysis (Braun and Clarke, 2006). Findings: The evaluation of the implementation of the WHO TCC showed an improvement in care for trauma patients in an emergency setting in a tertiary hospital in Nepal. There were improvements in the documentation in trauma management, showing the training had a direct impact on the quality of care of trauma patients. Notably, there was an improvement in cervical spine examination from 56.1% before training to 78.1%; chest examination 125 (57.07%) before training and 170 (77.62%) post-training; abdominal examination 121 (55.25%) before training and 169 (77.16%) post-training; gross motor examination 13 (5.93%) before training and 131 (59.82%) post-training; sensory examination 4 (1.82%) before training and 115 (52.51%) post-training; distal pulse examination 6 (2.73%) before training and 122 (55.7%) post-training. However, while the quality of documentation for trauma patients improved from the baseline of 56%, it only reached 78% when the percentage improvement target agreed for this research project was 90%. The 10 (n = 10) doctors and 15 (n = 15) nurses in the Emergency Department (ED) all improved their baseline knowledge from 72.2% to 87% (p = 0.00006), by 14.8% and 67% to 85%) (p = 0.006), respectively. Nurses started with lower scores (mean 67) in the baseline when compared to doctors, but they made significant gains in their learning post-training. The qualitative data reported barriers, such as the busyness of the department, with residents and medical officers, suggesting a shortened version of the checklist to support greater protocol compliance. Embedding this research within TL provided a steer for successful innovation and change, identifying action for sustaining change over time. Research limitations/implications: The study is a single-centre study that involved trauma patients in an emergency department in one hospital in Nepal. There is a lack of internationally recognised trauma training in Nepal and very few specialist trauma centres; hence, it was challenging to teach trauma to clinicians in a single 1-h session. High levels of transformation of health services are required in Nepal, but the sample for this research was small to test out and pilot the protocol to gain wider stakeholder buy in. The rapid turnover of doctors and nurses in the emergency department, creates an additional challenge but encouraging a multi-disciplinary approach through TL creates a greater chance of sustainability of the WHO TCC. Practical implications: International protocols are required in Nepal to support the transformation of health care. This explanatory mixed methods research, which is part of an International Fellowship programme, provides evidence of direct improvements in the quality of patient care and demonstrates how TL can drive improvement in a low- to medium-income country. Social implications: The Nepal/UK Hybrid International Emergency Medicine Fellowships have an opportunity to implement changes to the health system in Nepal through research, by bringing international level standards and protocols to the hospital to improve the quality of care provided to patients. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this research paper is one of the first studies of its kind to demonstrate direct patient level improvements as an outcome of the two-year MTI scheme. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited."

METHOD The original questionnaire was in English and the target version was in Greek. The process of translation into Greek was applied and then the translation of the Greek version into English, and finally the translation and cross-cultural adaptation process was checked. To test the reliability of the questionnaire, a test-retest study was conducted. Confirmatory factor analysis was performed to check validity. RESULTS The kappa indices in initial measurement and re-measurement for the seven questions of “Global Transformational Leadership scale” were found to have statistically significant relationships, indicating high reliability of the questionnaire. Furthermore, the high reliability of the questionnaire is also indicated by the fact that the intraclass correlation coefficient for the total score was extremely high and, more specifically, equal to 0.95 (95% confidence interval: 0.89 to 0.98, p<0.001). According to the results of the confirmatory factor analysis, the Greek version of the “Global Transformational Leadership scale” showed excellent fit, as all indicators had acceptable values. Moreover, the weighted regression weights had high values as they ranged from 0.74 to 0.89. Thus, it can be concluded that “Global Transformational Leadership scale” has high construct validity and is unidimensional. CONCLUSIONS The Greek version of the “Global Transformational Leadership scale” has high reliability and validity and is a valid tool to assess the transformational leadership style of those in positions of responsibility. © 2024, BETA Medical Publishers Ltd.

Survey data were obtained from elementary school staff and students, and school-aggregated student achievement test scores were obtained from school archives. Results showed that staff reports of principal behaviors could be described in terms of the three components of transformational leadership: inspiration or charisma, individualized consideration, and intellectual stimulation. Principal transformational leadership was not associated directly with either school staff turnover or school-aggregated student achievement progress. Rather, principal transformational leadership showed an indirect effect, through staff job satisfaction, on school staff turnover (negative) and on school-aggregated student achievement progress (positive). Finally, higher levels of school staff job satisfaction were associated with smaller achievement gaps between minority and non-minority students. This result was more evident among schools having higher levels of principal transformational leadership. Results are discussed in relation to the role of transformational leadership in school performance and in recruiting, training, and evaluating school principals. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited."

Coaching has demonstrated potential in leadership development with high returns on investment. This could be transferred to healthcare and may be of benefit in improving quality of care cost-effectively. This would require long-term changes to develop a coaching culture in healthcare. Aim: The aim of this study is to understand the views of clinicians on leadership roles and the use of coaching as a development tool. Method: The study was questionnaire-based with ethical approval from the organisation where the study was done. The study had both qualitative and quantitative elements. Analysis of quantitative measures was done by Chi square test. P = 0.05 regarded as significant. The views on key aspects of leadership were coded against the medical leadership competency framework. Results: Forty questionnaires were sent out and 22 returned (55% response rate). Most of the respondents were in post for at least 10 years and viewed their clinical role as leadership. Significantly more respondents were in post for longer than 10 years and those in post under 10 years were significantly more likely to consider other training tools apart from coaching. The majority rated their leadership at six or higher on a scale of 1-10. Fifty-nine percent had training in leadership and this is reflected in low scores on the need for further training, although most would accept training and that it has a role in leadership development. Regarding leadership roles, respondents' views were coded to the medical leadership competency framework with setting direction having the highest match (30%). The views also had aspects of charismatic and transformational leadership styles. Coaching was felt to be a useful tool in developing leadership although there were some concerns in ensuring confidentiality and match between coach and coached. Most would consider use of a coach but expressed as a whole the view that the coach should be experienced, from outside the organisation and have a healthcare background. Conclusions and recommendations: The study indicates that training in leadership for development is supported by clinicians in leadership roles and that there is support for coaching as a developmental tool with a preference for external coaches with a healthcare background. This appears to be primarily due to seniority of clinicians and concerns around confidentiality and independence. Further work should be explored to promote a coaching culture amongst clinicians. © 2012 Radcliffe Publishing."

Diverse theories suggest different styles of leadership, with strong relationships between the different styles and their outcomes. The transformational style emphasizes motivating employees and encouraging them to find new ways of dealing with issues. The transactional (TL) style promotes ideas of rewards and punishments. The Laissez-faire style is characterized by relaxation and the tendency to leave things to happen with minimal interference. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a descriptive cross-sectional study design conducted in Primary Healthcare Centers in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. The leadership styles were assessed using a Multi-Factor Leadership Questionnaire, which identifies the different styles of leadership. SPSS v 26.0 was used for data analysis. t-test employed to compare leadership style between raters and managers. Logistics regression model used to determine the influence of leadership styles of managers. Pearson correlation coefficient determined the linear relationship between leadership styles and its domains. RESULTS: A total of 130 respondents (65 managers vs. 65 raters) took part. 'Raters' refer to any persons other than the manager, such as a secretary, nurse, doctor. The 'manager' is when the person rates himself. The global transformation mean score was 3.55, for TL it was 3.42 and for passive avoidant, the mean score was 0.93. The passive avoidant (t = 2.005; P = 0.047) and management by exception (passive) (MBEP) mean scores of raters were statistically significantly higher than managers. In the binary regression model, MBEP was the independent significant predictor of manager. CONCLUSION: The perceived leadership style of Primary Healthcare Center managers was transformational but with TL. Transformational leadership was positively correlated with TL leadership but negatively correlated with passive avoidant (The Laissez-faire style). The outcome of this study demonstrated that intellectual stimulation, idealized attributes, and inspirational motivation are perhaps better than contingent reward, active management. © 2022 Journal of Family and Community Medicine | Published by Wolters Kluwer-Medknow."

Objectives: The aims of this analytical cross-sectional study were to evaluate the self-reported leadership behaviours and the factors influencing leadership behaviours among dentists who were heads of dental departments in community hospitals, southern Thailand. Materials and methods: The self-administered questionnaire was composed of four parts: personal data; a 45-item Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire version 5× short (MLQ 5× short); a 34-item organisational climate perception; and a 52-item emotional intelligence screening test. Results: Of 134 dentists, 133 returned the questionnaire, providing a 99.3% response rate. The scores on the transactional component had a mean score of 2.98 (SD = 0.46). The transformational scores ranged with a mean of 2.90 (SD = 0.49). The scores of the passive leadership component had the lowest results, with a mean of 1.21 (SD = 0.57). Afterwards, the highest score for each head of the dental department was examined and compared across the three components. Approximately 60% of the dentists fell on the transactional, 34.6% on the transformational and 2.3% on the passive–avoidant scale. Multiple linear regression showed that the factors influencing the leadership of the dentists included emotional intelligence, the professional position of the dentists and the perception of the organisational climate. Conclusions: The majority of heads of dental departments had transactional leadership style followed by transformational leadership style, and passive–avoidance was the least common. Emotional intelligence, the professional position and the perception of the organisational climate significantly increased the transformational leadership score. © 2020 FDI World Dental Federation"

We examined if the relation between intelligence (IQ) and perceived leadership might be more accurately described by a curvilinear single-peaked function. Following Simonton's (1985) theory, we tested a specific model, indicating that the optimal IQ for perceived leadership will appear at about 1.2 standard deviations above the mean IQ of the group membership. The sample consisted of midlevel leaders from multinational private-sector companies. We used the leaders' scores on the Wonderlic Personnel Test (WPT)-a measure of IQ-to predict how they would be perceived on prototypically effective leadership (i.e., transformational and instrumental leadership). Accounting for the effects of leader personality, gender, age, as well as company, country, and time fixed effects, analyses indicated that perceptions of leadership followed a curvilinear inverted-U function of intelligence. The peak of this function was at an IQ score of about 120, which did not depart significantly from the value predicted by the theory. As the first direct empirical test of a precise curvilinear model of the intelligence-leadership relation, the results have important implications for future research on how leaders are perceived in the workplace. © 2017 American Psychological Association."

The research associated with school leadership agrees that an effective principal produces a positive effect on the students' academic achievement. Currently, there are three major leadership approaches, which apply to the educational context. Instructional leadership refers to the development of learning improvement plans, while transformational leadership is associated with improving motivation as well as collaborative work. On the other hand, distributed leadership aims to empower people on the task of assuming leadership roles considering school context. This study uses instructional leadership as a cornerstone to define a basic organizational structure for the further development of more sophisticated leadership approaches. The instructional leadership model developed by Hallinger (2012) is used as a reference to suggest specific actions, based on current research, to develop an effective implementation of this school leadership style."

Hence, this study aimed to extend the integrated leadership model by conceptualizing the moderating mediation effect of IL on student academic achievement in public primary schools. A cross-sectional study was performed by distributing a survey to 1280 public primary school teachers in Addis Ababa. Surprisingly, the study's findings affirmed that unlike previous studies, IL and TL significantly directly affect student academic performance, and TL plays a significant role as a moderator of the indirect effect of IL on student academic achievement. The application of school leadership in fostering school improvement in non-Western countries is less known and understood.School principals with academic qualifications in school leadership exhibited an exceeding knowledge and skill in practicing leadership to enrich school improvement.Instructional and transformational leadership models have a substantial influence on student academic performance."

Researchers employed a rigorous three-level Structural Equation Model to investigate multi-dimensional relationships among the aforementioned variables. The results suggest that principal transformational leadership is significantly and positively related to teacher leadership. Meanwhile, principal transformational leadership and teacher leadership are both positively related to teacher self-efficacy, but only teacher leadership is positively related to student learning.

Methodology: From a non-probabilistic sample of 30 directors of Mexican educational institutions, basic, intermediate, and higher levels, and using the data obtained from the Multifactorial Leadership Questionnaire ( MlQ ) their leadership styles were identified. Key findings: The results show the directors have a mixed, transactional, and transformational leadership style; in particular, the idealized behavioral influence style stands out. Conclusions: With adequate guidance, it is proposed to develop the transformational leadership talents of directors of educational institutions and their teams.

This article presents a multivariate meta-analysis of 42 empirical studies, published between 2000 and 2020, that examined the effects of principal leadership on student achievement in the United States. The focus is on the conceptual models and methodological approaches used to examine these effects. Our study reveals three major findings: (a) principal leadership had a positive impact on student achievement, when the effects were conceptualized as direct effects without controls (0.25 SD), or as indirect effects (0.22 SD); (b) the observed effects of principal leadership are contingent upon how impacts were conceptualized and analyzed; and (c) substantial heterogeneity existed in observed principal leadership effects, with student outcome measure serving as a significant moderator. We offer directions for future studies, including conducting more replication studies using high-quality approaches across different contexts; developing common typologies, sets of variables and their definitions and measurements; identifying significant mediators in the school process; applying multiple conceptual models and methodological approaches on a more comprehensive dataset; and moving beyond the effectiveness perspective to adopting an equity lens."

The research included a sample of top-level school leaders in a Portuguese region. We analyzed the data with descriptive statistics and content analysis techniques. Participants reported that most of principals' leadership practices did not focus on student learning, but rather on school administration and management. Many respondents felt that it was not their job to lead in several instruction-related areas. Furthermore, respondents regarded the impact of most of principals' instructional leadership practices on student achievement as weak.

After teachers and teaching, school leadership is the most important determinant of learner achievement in school. Despite this, there is still uncertainty regarding what successful school leadership is and what successful school leaders do in non-Western contexts. In this mixed methods study I explored successful high school leadership in South Africa. Specifically, a questionnaire was administered to 38 principals from academically high-achieving schools from a range of socioeconomic contexts throughout the Western Cape, and 14 principals were interviewed. An integrated analysis reveals the paradox of uniqueness and universality of successful school leadership in South Africa, outlining that while there is no single best approach, various similarities exist between successful school leaders and established international literature. I found that successful principals adapt to their context, amalgamate transformational, instructional and distributed leadership styles, set direction, develop people, constantly realign the school with teaching and learning, and, importantly, strive to make a difference in the lives of others. It is about leading with Ubuntu. By highlighting these characteristics and practices, I offer theoretical, practical and personal advice to current and aspiring school leaders, academics and policy makers."

The results revealed non-significant relationships between the generic Principal Leadership (PL) and student achievement in all domains in both Germany and China. Significant relationships were found between the sub-dimensions of principal leadership and student achievement in both countries, with the exception of developing people (P3) in Germany and instructional leadership (P2) in China.

The purpose of this paper is to test a model of integrated transformational leadership including three important school mediators. Design/methodology/approach-In total, 5,392 students provided data on student engagement, and 569 teachers provided survey data on principal leadership and the collective teacher efficacy (CTE) and extra effort of their colleagues. Data were analyzed at the school level (n = 51) using mediation analysis with the PROCESS macro to calculate the direct and indirect effects of all of the variables in the serial multiple mediator model. Findings-The model explained a significant amount of variance in both reading (38 percent) and mathematics (35 percent). CTE and student engagement mediated all of the leadership effects, demonstrating the importance of teacher and student relations in school improvement. The combined effect sizes are significantly greater than the effects of earlier TL models. Originality/value-This study contributes to ""leadership for learning"" research by demonstrating that refining transformational leadership behaviors to include instructional management can enhance a leader's impact on achievement. As one of the few studies to examine student engagement as a mediator along with teacher mediators, the current study highlights the importance of teacher-student relations in school improvement. While collective efficacy mediated all of the effects of leadership on achievement, student emotional engagement also contributed to mathematics achievement. The study's findings advance research into mutual influence processes, indicating that reciprocity may extend throughout the leader-teacher-student loop."

Because transformative leadership has been demonstrated to have a positive impact on school atmosphere and student performance, we set out to investigate what factors influenced its development in this paper. Teacher organizational commitment is a significant factor for improving school outcomes, especially student academic achievement. But, it is still unclear what factors influence teacher commitment to student learning in Chinese secondary schools. Hence, in this paper, we reviewed the factors influencing teacher commitment for educational excellence.Also, the teachers' level of organizational commitmentwith regard to the commitment to school, to teaching works, to work group and to teachingoccupation are described in this paper."

Our motivation originates in the increasing trend in their share within the general population and the premise that this unique population may respond differently to school principal leadership style. Datasets on students' previous performance, students' background characteristics, teacher profiles, and school features were collected. In addition, a questionnaire on teachers' perceptions of their school principal's leadership style was distributed. Datasets were collected from 92 teachers who worked in special education needs public schools that specialized in conduct disorders. Using STATA software, we measured multilevel fixed-effects models. We found that the more the school principal is perceived as a transformational leader, the higher the students' performance. Additionally, secondary school advantaged students (i.e. having a high level of previous performance, high socioeconomic strata), who are taught by more educated teachers, exhibit higher performance compared with their counterparts. Based on our finding, we recommend that policy makers would consider assigning transformational leaders to low-performing schools. In addition, policy makers may want to allocate extra learning resources and to provide access to learning services to support the disadvantaged students' learning process."

Considerable debate has emerged over the most suitable model for academic leadership: not surprisingly, one of the conceptual models dominating the literature is transformational leadership. This study proposes to investigate academic leadership behavior from the perspective of transformational leadership. First, this paper reviews transformational leadership as a concept in detail with its four components: Charismatic Leadership, or Idealized Influence, Inspirational Motivation, Intellectual Stimulation, and Individualized Consideration. Second, the methodological details and the results of the study are explicitly discussed. The Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire (MLQ) is used to measure different components of transformational leadership as a research instrument. The total field under survey consists of 100 participants including research assistants, instructors, associate professors and full professors of different state universities in Turkey. The SPSS 15.0 (Statistical Package for Social Sciences) is applied to analyze the data gathered by the research instrument. In order to determine whether or not there has been any difference among the academics' perceptions of transformational leadership, with its four dimensions, according to gender, age, tenure, and education variables, non-parametric tests are used. As for the results of the study, the level of 5-point Likert scale measuring the administrators' behavior from the perspective of transformational leadership including all four dimensions is ""once a while"". Of the independent variables, only the education variable is specified as a significant factor affecting the academics' perceptions of transformational leadership. In other words, the level of transformational leadership attitude for the ones having bachelor's degree is indicated to be higher than the others, while the levels are indicated as similar for the ones having B.Ed. and M.A. degrees. In the dimensions of Idealized Influence and Inspirational Motivation, the level of PhD graduates' perceptions of transformational leadership is higher than that of M.A. graduates. In the dimensions of Intellectual Stimulation and Individualized Consideration, the levels are specified to be similar between the M.A. and PhD graduates. (C) 2015 The Authors.

Transcriptions of the interviews and field notes were made available immediately after each interview and observation, and NVivo software was used to manage the data more systemically. The data analysis identified the following four main effective practices of principals to enhance school outcomes: planning for shared vision, mission and goals; organising professional development programs; promoting the culture of innovation, collaboration and teamwork; and supervising a dynamic and proactive teaching and learning environment. Among these practices, principals should emphasize leadership functions, particularly teacher's professional development and instructional supervision.

Therefore, the enhancement of school leadership for student competency has become a key research topic. Leadership for learning is particularly relevant to these research developments. Leadership theories formulated in the past few decades center on the relationship between principal and teacher leadership and their influence on student performance. However, a research gap still exists in this area. This study explores the influence of principal and teacher leadership for learning on student core competency. This investigation reports a series of competency-based correlations involving principals, teachers, and students. Literature The ultimate goal of school-based education is the enhancement of student learning outcomes, and principal and teacher leadership should be directed toward this end. The joint investigation of principal and teacher leadership to understand their influence on school processes and student performance is central to modern school leadership research (e.g., Hallinger & Heck, 2010; Heck & Hallinger, 2009; Leithwood & Mascall, 2008; Louis et al., 2010; Spillane, 2006). These studies have primarily discussed the crucial influence of principal and teacher leadership on student learning and describe the intermediary role of teacher leadership. For example, Sebastian et al. (2017) studied the relationship of principal leadership with that of teachers to observe its influence on student performance; thus, they elucidated both the direct and indirect effects of leadership on student achievement. Their results indicated that principal leadership influences students in two respects. First, teacher leadership mediates this influence on students, and, second, teacher leadership mediates the influences of principal and teacher leadership on student performance. Another study by Sebastian et al. (2016) also reported that teacher leadership plays a key intermediary role between principal leadership and student achievement.. Methods The subjects of the study were teachers of elementary and junior high schools in Taiwan, and the survey was conducted by means of an online anonymous questionnaire. 200 schools were randomly selected, and the selected schools were requested to send the online anonymous questionnaire URL to all teachers of the school. A total of 1,615 questionnaires were recovered, including invalid questionnaires. After deducting invalid questionnaires, 1,490 valid questionnaires were finally recovered, and the effective rate of questionnaire recovery was 92.26%. Results and Discussion (1) According to survey results, participants had a moderate to high level of principal and teacher leadership in relation to learning and a moderate level of student core competency. Principal leadership for learning scores were the highest, indicating that principals were most influential in developing competency-based education. (2) Most studies have reported a low to nonsignificant direct influence of principal leadership on student learning (Bryk et al., 2010; Witziers et al., 2003); this is consistent with the low level of influence reported in this study. (3) This study found that teacher leadership for learning has a highly positive and direct influence on student core competency. The results of this study are consistent with those reported in the literature on teacher leadership. The primary purpose of teacher leadership is to strengthen the leadership behaviors for students to enhance learning effectiveness (Childs-Bowen et al., 2000; Danielson, 2006; Zheng & Chen, 2013), and the ultimate goal is to improve student learning performance (Carpenter & Sherretz, 2012; Hanuscin et al., 2012; Hunzicker, 2012; Vernon-Dotson & Floyd, 2012). These same principles inform competency-based education. (4) This study demonstrates that principal leadership for learning moderately affects student core competency; this influence is mediated by teacher leadership for learning and is higher than the direct influence of principal leadership for learning on student core competency. These results indicate that principals must develop student core competency through teachers, consistent with the findings of Leithwood et al. (2010). Through the principal and teacher leadership, schools can influence student learning performance. Teacher leadership is a key intermediary between principal leadership and student learning (Sebastian et al., 2016; Sebastian et al., 2017). Conclusions (1) Elementary and junior high school principal leadership for learning is a key promoter of competency-based education in 12-year basic education. (2) Elementary and junior high school principal leadership for learning exhibits a significant, positive, and strong direct influence on teacher leadership for learning. (3) Elementary and junior high school principal leadership for learning exhibits a significant, positive, and moderate to low direct influence on student core competency.

Unquestionably, leadership is the most deliberate field within the social sciences. Still, administrators have evaded the notions of leadership concept like a haunting tune. This study has focused particularly on the significance of varied leadership styles in teaching to sustain academic excellence at the secondary school level. The quantitative research method was used. Data was collected through the scale of diverse leadership styles (strategic, cultural, instructional leaderships and sustaining academic excellence) from 103 secondary schools in Punjab, Pakistan. The sample consisted of 540 teachers who were enacting as teachers presently. Based on research objectives and questions, two hypotheses were formed and tested using mean analysis to determine the average ranking of leadership styles. Pearson correlation to know the statistically significant relationship between each leadership styles, and overall scales with sustaining academic excellence. The results revealed that most teachers give preference strategic Leadership, then instructional leadership, and finally cultural leadership in their teaching to sustain academic excellence. Moreover, the findings also indicated that a statistically strong positive relationship among diverse leadership styles in teaching and sustaining academic excellence with the value (r = 0.752). Based on the findings, it has been concluded that when teachers increase their effort in the use of strategic, instructional, and cultural leadership styles, academic excellence may also sustain and improve."

Using survey and administrative data from high schools in a large urban context, the paper explores direct and indirect pathways from leadership to student achievement growth. The results indicate that there are 2 pathways through which principal leadership is related to student learning in high schools. One pathway is mediated by teacher leadership, whereas the second pathway does not include teacher leadership.

Adopting Grissom and Loeb's measurement framework, we use both exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses to examine the structure of principal leadership. Then, a hierarchical linear model is employed to analyze the relationship between principal leadership and five school outcomes, controlling for basic student and teacher demographics and certain school context variables. Findings: We identify many differences and some similarities between China and the United States. We obtain five leadership factors from the principals' self-rating data (Visibility and Direct Participation, Instruction Organization, Internal Environment Organization, Planning and Personnel, and External Relations) and three leadership factors from the teachers' rating data (Organization and Management, Instruction and Curriculum, and Visibility and Direct Participation). Regarding student reading achievement and learning efficacy, from both the principals' and teachers' perspectives, the most highly correlated aspect is Instruction Organization.

The conceptual framework highlights the interaction between leaders in varied situations characterized by leadership functions and country contexts. Research Design: Researchers use both principal and teacher surveys from the 2013 TALIS. In the first analytical stage, latent measures using confirmative factor analysis capture the extent to which principals and teachers were responsible for each of the three leadership functions; scatterplots explore distribution of interactive leadership, and further explanation is offered by document analysis of country policy profiles. In the second stage, the research uses hierarchical linear models for the effect of distributed leadership, specifically principal leadership, teacher leadership, and interactive leadership, on school culture for each country, synthesizing country results with meta-analysis. Findings: Distributed leadership varies by leadership function and appears to be influenced by country education policy. Teachers report that their school culture is conducive to distributed leadership when, in fact, they have the opportunity to lead. Conclusions: Findings add global evidence that country context is an important part of the situation for distributed leadership.

The study's sample group consisted of 325 teachers employed in primary education institutions. The Leadership Style Scale, Teacher Classroom Leadership Scale, and Teacher Professional Motivation Scale were used to collect data. We found that although teachers' classroom leadership levels were higher than principals' leadership levels, principals' leadership had a higher direct impact on teacher motivation than did teacher classroom leadership and that quality interaction both in school and in the classroom is the single most influential component on teacher classroom leadership and motivation. Our findings suggest that the primary determinant of teacher classroom leadership and motivation lies in the quality of interactions within both the school and classroom environments. These results underscore the significance of principals' leadership roles in current scholarly discussions on shared leadership in educational settings and on the conceptualization of teacher leadership. Consequently, sharing leadership does not diminish its impact but rather amplifies it.

Three-level structural equation modeling indicates that family and school contexts influenced the enactment of principal leadership. Specifically, principals were able to exercise leadership (envisioning, conducting instructional management, promoting professional development, and advocating empowerment) in schools with more science resources. In contrast, principals seemingly addressed teacher capacity issues by envisioning and promoting the professional development and empowerment of teachers in schools with low socioeconomic status. The instructional management of principals was positively related to the enjoyment and interest of students in science, and those with high levels of such learning attitudes obtained high levels of science achievement.

The authors examined the following research questions: does the school context influence the principal's leadership? When the influences of the school context are controlled for, does the principal's leadership influence the process variables related to teachers and educational climate? Design/methodology/approach - The research questions are analysed in a multilevel context by developing two models regarding the hypothesized relationships between the study variables. With the use of multilevel structural equation modelling techniques the models were empirically tested on data from Italian teachers and students from a sample of schools in Italy. The database include 1,566 teachers from 47 schools of different types and levels from the Autonomous Province of Trento. Findings - In those schools which have the highest leadership scores, the authors also find a greater degree of job satisfaction among the teachers, higher levels of self-efficacy of teachers, and a better educational climate, which is more respectful of the basic rules of coexistence existing within the school. An interesting additional element is that the positive relationship between the exercise of leadership and the process variables related to academic success is still present, even if the effects of the school context are controlled for. Research limitations/implications - It should be observed that the results of this study, particularly due to the non-representative nature of the sample considered, should be considered as preliminary evidence that will require further confirmation, and which cannot be immediately generalized. The results obtained can be influenced by the specific territorial area in which this search has been conducted. The Autonomous Province of Trento, from the rest of Italy, is characterized by a highly centralized education system, with a relative homogeneity of the conditions of the context in which schools have achieved so widespread high levels of student learning. Originality/value - When studying leadership it is important to consider the school context, particularly the role of the initial level of learning of the students, as this study shows that in schools where the prior knowledge of students is greater, teachers are generally more satisfied with their job and they report a better educational environment. If the influence of the context were not taken into account, this could easily be mistaken for that of the actions of the principal."

The study sought to examine the influence of transformational leader behavior by school principals as it related to organizational commitment, organizational citizenship behavior, teacher satisfaction with leader, and student academic performance. Attitudinal and behavioral data were collected from both teachers and principals; student academic performance was collected from school records. School level analyses showed that transformational leadership had significant add-on effects to transactional leadership in the prediction of organizational commitment, organizational citizenship behavior, and teacher satisfaction. Moreover, transformational leadership was found to have indirect effects on student academic achievement. Finally, it was found that transactional leadership had little add-on effect on transformational leadership in predicting outcomes. Implications and directions for future research are discussed."

To address this gap in the literature, this case study examines two major issues: how the principals at four charter schools enact instructional leadership in their respective schools, and what barriers the principals encounter when enacting instructional leadership at their school sites. The results highlight three main categories of instructional leadership practices: developing a school mission, managing curriculum and instruction, and promoting school climate and culture. In addition, the data reveal that while the principals attempted to engage in instructional leadership, they encountered barriers related to budgeting and staffing. The paper broadens the scholarly understanding of instructional leadership in schools with high levels of autonomy."

For assessing principals' transformational leadership, the Leadership Practice Inventory (LPI) and the Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire (MLQ) were used. In this paper, we first compare the two concepts based on theory. We used this to develop predictions of the relationships among dimensions that comprise the models. We then compare the actual correlations among the constructs obtained in the two studies. Results show a strong fit of empirical data and our theoretical predications.

It acknowledges that leadership responsibilities are shared across stakeholders, inviting wider sources of leadership. If leadership for learning conceptualizes leadership as an organization-wide practice beyond that of an individual (e.g. the school principal), its measurement must accordingly invite perceptions and experiences of diverse stakeholders at multiple levels. Focusing solely on principals' or teachers' leadership perceptions is problematic since it fails to capture the unique lived realities teachers or principals experience concerning leadership enactment. It also limits the capacity to examine whether and how these multiple perspectives exert same or divergent impacts on staff development, school culture, and student learning. Thus, this study employed leadership for learning as its theoretical framework and rigorous multilevel factor analysis techniques to examine the extent to which individual teachers, teachers collectively, and principals show distinct perceptions of leadership practices. Four-fold cross-validation multilevel factor analysis revealed conceptual distinctions in how the three entities experience leadership practices distributed across the school.

For the meta-analysis, the Hunter-Schmidt approach was adopted, and thus, correlations were corrected for attenuation due to measurement error. The findings indicated that transformational instructor-leadership was positively associated with students' motivation, satisfaction, perceptions of instructor credibility, academic performance, affective learning, and cognitive learning. Moderator analyses revealed that culture, course delivery, instrument, and gender were all significant moderators of the relationship between transformational instructor-leadership and specific student outcomes. The findings also showed that there were significant differences between the transformational leadership dimensions, thus supporting the notion that each dimension is conceptually distinct. The present meta-analysis drew from varied disciplines in contributing the first integrative review on transformational instructor-leadership.

This study, going beyond simply evaluating whether these two modes of leadership complement or contradict each other, explores how they may intersect in complex and nuanced ways. Specifically, I examine the moderating effect of transformational leadership on the impact of instructional leadership on student outcomes. Research Design: A questionnaire, composed of items to measure instructional and transformational leadership, student outcomes, school background factors, and informant's demographic variables, was sent to the vice-principals in Hong Kong schools. Hierarchical regression analysis was used to factor out the effect of informants' personal and school factors on leadership perception and student outcomes in the testing of the moderating effect.

The Organizational Leadership Model hypothesizes four distinct conditions of school leadership, and the analysis investigates the relationship between teacher, principal, and school outcomes; school descriptors; and a school's category in the Organizational Leadership Model. Theoretical Orientation: Ogawa and Bossert's conception of leadership as an organizational quality serves as the theoretical foundation of this study, along with contemporary theories of distributed leadership, influence as leadership, and measurement of leadership. Data Source: This study draws teacher, principal, and school restricted-use data from the 2003-2004 Schools and Staffing Survey. The sample consists of 7,950 schools, their principals, and a random sample of teachers from each school. The school is the primary unit of analysis. Analysis: This study is conducted in two phases. In Phase 1, the Organizational Leadership Model (OLM) is tested for its ability to discriminate between teacher, principal, and school outcomes through a series of one-way ANOVA models. In Phase 2, a series of brr weighted ordered logit models explores the predictive power of school descriptors in determining the OLM category of schools. Findings: The analysis finds evidence that the Organizational Leadership Model is a robust measure of leadership as an organizational quality that effectively captures differences in school leadership contexts at the level of principals' and teachers' perceptions of their influence that precede task-oriented behaviors. Additionally, the study highlights the troubling relationship between schools serving high-need populations and those typified by low levels of school leadership. Implications for Research and Practice: The article identifies several avenues for future research to extend inquiry on the potential of the Organizational Leadership Model to develop additional nuance in discriminating between relationships among school contexts, leadership conditions, and teacher, principal, and school outcomes. The article further urges those implicit in maintaining the status quo of poor leadership accountability in schools, including those in the research community, to seek interventions at the level of principal and teacher perceptions of and professional standards for their practice."

While various styles, such as transformational, instructional, shared instructional, point to the similar measures of high organizational quality, the inconsistency in how these styles are defined and relate make it unclear how principals systematically improve schools. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach - This study used the 1999-2000 schools and staffing survey, n = 8,524 of US principals, since it includes a nationally representative sample of administrators who responded to a comprehensive set of leadership measures around a time of school restructuring reforms. Confirmatory factor analysis was used to identify different styles, and to measure the extent of their relationship. These factors were used to test a theory about why principals practice each of these styles to a different degree based on levels of shared instructional leadership. Findings - Based on the theoretical framework, principals should have a similar high influence over resources, safety and facilities regardless of degree of shared instructional leadership since these tasks address foundational school needs. However, principal and teacher influence over these resources differed across levels of shared instructional leadership more than principal-directed tasks of facilitating a mission, supervising instruction and building community. Originality/value - Differences in the practice of styles by shared instructional leadership did not fit changing, higher ordered needs as theorized instead seemed to vary by a hierarchy of control, the way in which principals shared influence with teachers."

Findings suggest that their notions of leadership as well as any developmental needs/activities perceived useful, differ according to their leadership level. Although junior leaders were more concerned with procedural elements of leading, senior leaders focused on mentoring, social expectations and knowledge of academia. These findings have important implications for a wider theoretical conceptualisation of academic leadership, which are typically focused on individual senior leaders. Further, our findings inform leadership development programmes, as universities' dealings with academic leaders tend not to consider the differing requirements of junior, middle and senior academic leaders."

Research Methods: The schools were selected from a geographically stratified sample of public middle schools in a state in the southeastern United States. Multiple linear regression was used to identify schools performing better than expected considering their levels of poverty and other school-related factors. The final three schools, one from each geographic region, showed steady increases in academic achievement and school climate following the arrival of their principals. Data were primarily collected from interviews with principals, teaching and nonteaching staff, and parents using protocols adapted from the International Successful School Principalship Project. Findings: The findings explicate the large degree to which the leadership practices and beliefs that influenced student achievement in these schools were adapted to and commensurate with each school's immediate context. Furthermore, they illustrate how principals used these practices to institutionalize school-wide reform efforts as vehicles for leading change within their schools. Implications: The findings substantiate research on successful school leadership in high-needs middle schools. They also extend this research by examining the way core transformational and instructional leadership practices can be adapted to suit various school contexts and institutionalize school-wide reform efforts to enhance student learning. Further research is required to understand how principals decide to adapt their leadership practices, and how aspiring leaders can best learn to do so."

We also explored the predictive properties of the instrument in predicting student achievement at the school level. Based on 53 schools, we found that the instrument can indeed measure the kind of school leadership that really matters to student achievement.

Moderator analyses showed that school leadership effects were significant in studies using a school-level analysis but not in those using a lower-level of analysis. Additionally, school leadership effects were significant at different grade levels (G1-G6, G7-G12) and in research reported in different study types (articles, dissertations) and in different years (2000-2009, 2010-2018)."

Background Systematic reviews may inform public policies and contribute to the building of a knowledge base. However, reviews of school leadership research are relatively rare in Taiwan. This study conducted a bibliometric review to analyze journal papers by Taiwanese scholars in the Scopus database published in the previous 20 years. The focus was to examine the connection between Taiwanese and global research on school leadership. 2. Research questions On the basis of the research background, four research questions were proposed: (1) What is the volume and growth trajectory of Taiwanese school leadership research? (2) What is the international visibility of Taiwanese school leadership research as revealed through citation analysis? (3) What are the main topics covered by Taiwanese school leadership research and how do they correspond to the global trend? (4) What is the intellectual structure of Taiwanese school leadership research and how do it connect with the global literature? 3. Theoretical framework (1) Intellectual development of school leadership research The theory movement in the 1950s and 1960s highlighted the development of educational administration research. Griffiths (1959) categorized these theories into four groups: social system and role theory, leadership theory, decision theory, and organizational theory. In the 1970s, contingency theory, which emphasizes the influence of context on leadership, was proposed. With the growing interest in school effectiveness and school reform, the organizational perspective was applied to investigate school leadership. Instructional leadership was also emphasized from then on. In the 1990s, other leadership approaches such as transformational leadership, moral leadership, and distributed leadership became popular in school leadership research. With the power paradigm shifting from a heroic view of leaders to a more dispersed view of power, distributed leadership and teacher leadership were also highly recognized. In response to the international context, leadership for learning, which includes elements of instructional leadership, transformational leadership, and shared leadership, has gained global attention in the new millennium. (2) Retrospective view of school leadership research Systematic reviews did not appear in the field of educational administration until the 1980s. EPPI-Centre (2012) indicated the four key features of systematic reviews. First, a high quality systematic review is explicit and is conducted using transparent methods. Second, it follows a standard set of stages. Third, the review is accountable, replicable, and updateable. Fourth, users should be involved to ensure reports are relevant and useful. The elements of reviews include the central topics of interest, guiding questions, and goals; a conceptual perspective for guiding the review's selection, evaluation, and interpretation of the studies; sources and types of data; data evaluation and analysis; and the major results of the review (Hallinger, 2014). However, according to Hallinger's study in 2014, only eight reviews met these criteria. Of the eight studies, some used critical synthesis, some adopted meta-analysis, and some employed both. In recent years, network analysis, data mining, and bibliometric analysis are increasingly being applied in systematic reviews. In addition to a greater diversity in methods, the regions under review have expanded from the United States and United Kingdom to many other regions. This development can be attributed to Hallinger's effort to initiate international collaboration to build the knowledge base of educational leadership in Asia. Because of the growing interest in the academic development in non-Western countries, he promoted the use of systematic reviews to examine studies in Asia, Africa, Saudi Arabia, and Central and South America, which resulted in more than 30 systematic reviews on educational leadership and management. A wide range of research topics is a prominent feature of educational leadership and management research. Five topics that have gained frequent attention are social justice, female leadership, school leadership preparation and development, trust, and instruction and instructional leadership. The following are the topics of frontier research in this field: principal, school leadership, and student achievement; distributed leadership, instructional leadership, teacher learning, accountability, school improvement, school reform, and leadership development; and race, justice, and urban education. In Taiwan, research reviews on educational leadership are scant. According to Lin's (2000) review, only a few studies have focused on the impact of principals on students. Pan's (2010) review indicated that of all the educational leadership studies in government-funded projects and journals, 70% of the topics were related to principals' leadership styles and behaviors. The distribution of the research topics was not sufficiently diversified to reflect global academic development. 4. Research method This study used bibliometric analysis on the Scopus database to analyze Taiwanese school leadership research. The review process was based on the steps of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) developed by Moher et al. (2009). After the process of screening, identification, eligibility determination, and inclusion, 95 papers were included for analysis. Descriptive analysis, citation analysis, co-occurrence analysis of keywords, and co-citation analysis were conducted to address the research questions. 5. Research findings The study had the following three key findings: (1) Concerning the volume of publication in journals, the first English paper on Taiwanese school leadership research did not appear until 2001. Although the promotion of the world university rankings and the launch of the Top University Project have changed the trend of solely using Chinese for academic writing, the number of English studies on school leadership remains limited. Moreover, only 14.7% of papers are published in the core journals of education leadership and management. (2) A citation analysis revealed that the international visibility of Taiwanese school leadership research is low. The average number of papers of the 10 most cited Taiwanese scholars is 3.5, and they have been cited an average of 45.2 times. The number of citations of Taiwanese scholars is 3.33 times less than that of African educational leadership research and 11.78 times less than that of research on three emerging regions. (3) The research topics selected by Taiwanese scholars may highlight international academic development; however, some underdeveloped topics remain such as social justice leadership, organizational theory, institutional theory, and social capital. The current co-citation analysis revealed the four schools of thought of Taiwanese school leadership, namely leadership for learning, distributed forms of leadership, leadership behavior and its impact, and social network. 6. Contributions Systematic reviews on school leadership are scarce in Taiwan. The present study conducted a bibliometric analysis to examine the development and features of Taiwanese school leadership literature which is innovative in the research method. The connection between Taiwanese studies on school leadership research and global scholarship has seldom been addressed in relevant research. The current analysis presents the development of Taiwanese school leadership and its connection with global trends, providing critical insights and directions for future research on school leadership in Taiwan."

Given that multiple school functions are needed to serve society at different levels, the required roles in school leadership are inevitably multiple, diverse and demanding. In past decades, many studies have been conducted with a focus on some aspects of leadership functions and processes. Unfortunately, there is a lack of a typology of school leadership to map out comprehensive leadership profiles and understand their multiple characteristics for leading school development and effectiveness in a fast-changing environment. Based on the framework of multiple school effectiveness, this paper aims to propose a typology of multiple school leadership that can provide a new, comprehensive way to re-conceptualize the multiple nature and characteristics of school leadership in a complicated context. Depending on the rationalities, concerns, actions, outcomes and contexts of leadership in practice, the typology of multiple school leadership may include six models: technological leadership, economic leadership, social leadership, political leadership, cultural leadership, and learning leadership. Within this typology, new possibilities and approaches to school leadership can be drawn for research, practice and development towards the future."

In order to determine the level of school principals' 21st century skills and their strategic leadership, descriptive analysis was used as well as Pearson Correlation Analysis and Regression analysis. There were significant positive relationships between all dimensions of educational administrators' 21st century skills and strategic leadership behaviors. Besides, education managers' 21st century skills were found to be a significant predictor of their strategic leadership behaviors. As a result of the research, it was revealed that information literacy, technology literacy, accountability, leadership and responsibility were significant predictors of managerial leadership behavior. School administrators need to increase their levels of knowledge literacy, technological literacy, accountability, leadership, and responsibility skills in order to improve their managerial leadership behaviors."

At the system level, leadership was evident at the senior levels of the central and regional systems, with principal network leaders having potential to exercise occasional leadership. Principals tended not to operate as system leaders because they had limited influence across multiple schools. At a regional level, it was clear that directors acted as system level leaders, exerting wide influence on clusters of schools to improve. At a school level, the work of the principal, other school leaders, and critical friends was more important to the improvement journey of the school than system leadership. It seems that whilst system leadership can be important, it needs to work in conjunction with school leadership to maximize influence on school success."

School principals are expected to demonstrate proficiency when performing leadership and management roles in schools. Based on the fact that no certificate for principalship exists, newly appointed principals rely on their teaching experience to fulfil the responsibilities of the position. Gronn's theory advocating leadership as a career was used as a lens to analyse the data. In this qualitative study we used interviews and document verification to understand how new appointees perceived their new roles as school leaders and managers. The findings imply that beginner principals regard themselves as ill-prepared to lead and manage schools in their early years of appointment. Their perceptions were that they lacked leadership and management experience in the areas of curriculum, human resources, school finance, stakeholder relations and interpretation of legislation. Beginner principals viewed these as challenges for their leadership and management expertise. From the study we concluded that teachers needed to be exposed to leadership and management responsibilities and that newly appointed principals needed to be trained before they assumed their new positions."

Authors argue that basic leadership styles can have positive effects in learner performance. The study was conducted in best performing rural schools in the Eastern Cape Province. The belief is that poor performing schools can learn from successful schools. A phenomenological study with an interpretive-constructivism approach was conducted to establish basic leadership styles that can be used by rural school principals (which were purposely selected) to improve the academic performance of learners. Data collected through interviews were thematically analyzed and revealed that: democratic and autocratic leadership styles were used by successful rural secondary school principals; laissez-faire leadership style adversely affected culture of teaching and learning. It is recommended that the Department of Basic Education should spend more time and money on training principals on leadership skills.

Through our findings, we illustrate the varying degree to which each principal viewed the leaders' existing capacities, structured their leadership learning opportunities, guided their reflections, and assessed their learning in the context of leadership practice. An important finding was that the way the principals viewed leadership development and saw other leaders as learners themselves appeared to influence the way they developed other leaders' personal capacities."

Successful leadership is ensured by school leaders' compliance to a set of basic practices within particular school contexts. The impact of leadership styles on performance, the work environment and job satisfaction is emphasized, while the appropriate leadership style could make teachers more effective in terms of job productivity. The adoption of different leadership styles by school leaders shows positive results with regard to school effectiveness. The purpose of this paper is to describe school leadership styles and the influence the styles have on school performance. Design/methodology/approach A quantitative approach with a post-positive paradigm was followed. A systematic random sample of 72 secondary schools in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, was selected. The Cronbach's alpha coefficient, statistical significance (p-values) and effect size (d-values) were calculated, and a factor analysis was conducted. Findings The results show a difference between teachers and principals regarding the transformational leadership style. The principals in the high-performing schools were perceived as less passive-avoidant in practice than those in the low-performing schools. A principal manages and leads a school effectively by applying an appropriate leadership style. Research limitations/implications - For future research, it will be advisable tomake use of a mixed-method design. Although the Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire addressed numerous aspects of leadership and leadership styles, the ""voice"" of the respondents lacked. Furthermore, more leadership styles could be investigated in different contexts. Practical implications - A chosen principal leadership style is not necessarily the best style for this purpose. School principals and teachers interpret leadership styles differently. Communication is therefore important. Social implications The principal leadership style is not always necessarily the teachers' and learners' choice. It is important that schools keep up with a constantly changing world. Originality/value If school principals and teachers agree upon a specific leadership style, there may be better collaboration which enhances better academic performance as well as effectiveness regarding schools."

The conceptualization of educational leadership among researchers so far had been found to vary according to different contexts and situations. Theoretical perspectives associated with educational leadership have either approached the concept from dimensions working outside the school or from dimensions reflecting the personality trait of the principal. There is an urgent need to shift the focus of attention toward understanding educational leadership through an interactive collaboration of these dimensions. Specifically, in school contexts, the phenomenon of educational leadership was explored and theorized from one perspective only, giving less space to have multidisciplinary view, which need to be revived in terms of contexts and associated metaphors of educational leadership. Although the importance of educational leadership has been widely acknowledged, its role still remains unheeded in various sections of education. The purpose of the review, thus, is to gain macro-level insight into this concept which can hopefully answer many aspects of education which are otherwise left unanswered, thereby helping in formulating better educational reforms."

Research Design: The methodology involved an analysis of findings from 27 published studies of the relationship between leadership and student outcomes. Vie first meta-analysis, including 22 of the 27 studies, involved a comparison of the effects of transformational and instructional leadership on student outcomes. The second meta-analysis involved a comparison of the effects of five inductively derived sets of leadership practices on student outcomes. Twelve of the studies contributed to this second analysis. Findings: The first meta-analysis indicated that the average effect of instructional leadership on student outcomes was three to four times that of transformtional leadership. Inspection of the survey items used to measure school leadership revealed five sets of leadership practices or dimensions: establishing goals and expectations; resourcing strategically; planning, coordinating, and evaluating teaching and the curriculum; promoting and participating in teacher learning and development, and ensuring an orderly and supportive environment. The second meta-analysis revealed strong average effects for the leadership dimension involving promoting and participating in teacher learning and development and moderate effects for the dimensions concerned with goal setting and planning, coordinating, and evaluating teaching and the curriculum. Conclusions and Implications for Research and Practice: The comparisons between transformational and instructional leadership and between the five leadership dimensions suggested that the more leaders focus their relationships, their work, and their learning on the core business of teaching and learning, the greater their influence oil student outcomes. The article concludes with a discussion of the need for leadership research and practice to be more closely linked to the evidence on effective teaching and effective teacher learning.

Finally, the authors examined the contribution of exemplary leadership preparation to variations in school improvement progress and school effectiveness climate. Research Design: The study, using survey research conducted in 2005, compared 65 principals who had graduated from one of four selected exemplary leadership preparation programs to a national sample of 111 principals. The authors used structural equation modeling to find the best fit. Findings: Participation in an exemplary leadership preparation program was significantly associated with learning about effective leadership and engaging in these practices, particularly where stronger preparation program and internship quality existed. Frequent use of effective leadership practices was positively associated with school improvement progress and school effectiveness climate. Taken together, exemplary leadership preparation had a positive but mediated influence on variations in school improvement progress and school effectiveness climate; the relationship was even stronger when focusing on preparation program and internship quality measures. Conclusions: Faculty investments in preparation program and internship quality will positively contribute to the leadership knowledge of graduates and their leadership practices and school improvement progress.

Results indicated that teachers perceived their principals and immediate supervisors as exercising empowering behaviours in their daily practices, but they also perceived their principal and immediate supervisor differing in magnitude in some specific dimensions of empowering behaviours such as delegation of authority, providing individualised concern and support, articulating a vision and fostering collaborative relationships. Results also indicated that teachers' perceptions of principal's and immediate supervisor's empowering behaviours were positively associated with teachers' psychological empowerment, and that they added unique variance to each other in predicting teachers' psychological empowerment. This study suggests the importance of considering teachers' perceptions of principal's and immediate supervisor's empowering behaviours as two distinct constructs in empirical research so that their unique predictive power could be more aptly captured. From a practical standpoint, it suggests the importance for school leadership developers to enhance school leaders' awareness and capacity in exercising empowering behaviours towards their teachers in their daily practice.

It directly or indirectly influences almost all factors that affect school transformation. It influences students' academic, social, emotional, cultural, and moral wellbeing as well as the performance, commitment, citizenship behavior, innovativeness, and instructional practices of the teachers. Effective leadership is always multidimensional and complex. Leaders in successfully transformed schools demonstrate multiple and distinct leadership behaviors in order to influence different aspects of school life. They encompass the ability to be task-oriented, change-oriented, relation-oriented, and ethical-oriented leaders. The purpose of this paper is twofold. First, it intends to portray how the four dimensions of leadership behavior collectively give a better and comprehensive elucidation for understanding school leadership. Second, it aims to justify how these four dimensions of leadership behavior can be integrated together to facilitate school transformation process. This paper analytically reviews research and writings on school leadership behavior and proposes a conceptual model applicable and appropriate to explain leadership in the context of school transformation. The proposed model extends the tri-dimensional leadership behavior theory by incorporating ethical-oriented leadership behavior in it. In addition, the conceptual model is supported through review of literature for its applicability in schools. From the review, it is found that the current literature on leadership behavior is quite baffling. Different behavior dimensions explained by different researchers are sometimes overlapping and contrasting to each other on the same leadership concepts, actions, or outcomes. Moreover, the current literature on leadership behavior in school context is mainly related to transformational, transactional, and instructional leadership behaviors. Despite that, some researchers have criticized and found theoretical and empirical weaknesses in those leadership behaviors due to the intervening effects of factors such as culture, personality, organization structure, and government policy. Conversely, at the general theoretical level, researchers have categorized many leadership behaviors into certain orientations such as task-oriented, relation-oriented, change-oriented behaviors, and ethical-oriented leadership behaviors. These behavior dimensions are not just a group of distinct behaviors, but they also give a better platform to compare and contrast studies by different researchers. The behavior constructs included in them are clear and distinct. These leadership orientations cover almost all behaviors proposed in instructional, transformational, ethical, moral, distributed, and transactional leadership models."

Relatedly, findings of significant positive effects for eight different school leadership practices underscore the need to examine comprehensively the scope of school leaders' work beyond that related to teaching-and-learning. Additionally, leaders require myriad competencies and skills including how to galvanize, motivate and equip teachers to achieve school goals. The substantially larger mean effect sizes for organizational and teacher as compared to student outcomes challenge the assertion by some that principals are less consequential than teachers in contributing to school effectiveness. Indeed, the larger effect sizes for principals as compared to other types of leaders reflect the key role they play in leading schools."

While effective schools research has established that strong principal leadership affects school academic achievement at least indirectly, this relationship is more complex than originally thought. Personnel decisions about principal effectiveness made by educational policymakers or lay-controlled school site councils should be made only after careful consideration of research on the relationship between principal instructional leadership and school outcomes. This article presents data from a study to determine whether principal instructional leadership is predictive of school outcomes and discusses the implications of the research for developing school improvement strategies."

Design/methodology/approach - Guided by strong evidence from theories on school leadership and work psychology, the authors hypothesized relations among dimensions of principals' instructional and transformational leadership behaviors, teachers' perception of the school climate (social and affective, and physical environment), their job satisfaction and student achievement. The benefits of the principal's leadership behaviors for student achievement are primarily hypothesized as indirect, with either a weak or statistically non-significant direct positive effect on student outcomes. Path modeling was applied to validate a mediated-effects model using cross-sectional survey data (306 principals, 1,539 teachers) obtained from 306 secondary schools in the two Indian metropolitan cities of New Delhi and Kolkata. Findings - Principal leadership behaviors were not associated directly with either teacher job satisfaction or school-aggregated student achievement. Rather, the transformational leader behavior showed an indirect effect, through the social and affective component of the school climate, on teacher job satisfaction. The physical climate, however, appeared to play a dominating role in mediating the instructional leadership effects on teacher job satisfaction. Comparing the relative indirect effect sizes of the instructional and transformational leadership behaviors on student achievement, principals appear to favor the former approach. Originality/value - This study provides further empirical evidence that instructional leadership better captures the impact of school leadership on student outcomes, when compared to its transformational counterpart. By identifying the relative effects of different leadership practices, school leaders and educational practitioners can focus more on altering the distribution and frequency of those practices that work best for ameliorating student achievement levels."

The purpose of this paper is to test a model of integrated transformational leadership including three important school mediators. Design/methodology/approach-In total, 5,392 students provided data on student engagement, and 569 teachers provided survey data on principal leadership and the collective teacher efficacy (CTE) and extra effort of their colleagues. Data were analyzed at the school level (n = 51) using mediation analysis with the PROCESS macro to calculate the direct and indirect effects of all of the variables in the serial multiple mediator model. Findings-The model explained a significant amount of variance in both reading (38 percent) and mathematics (35 percent). CTE and student engagement mediated all of the leadership effects, demonstrating the importance of teacher and student relations in school improvement. The combined effect sizes are significantly greater than the effects of earlier TL models. Originality/value-This study contributes to ""leadership for learning"" research by demonstrating that refining transformational leadership behaviors to include instructional management can enhance a leader's impact on achievement. As one of the few studies to examine student engagement as a mediator along with teacher mediators, the current study highlights the importance of teacher-student relations in school improvement. While collective efficacy mediated all of the effects of leadership on achievement, student emotional engagement also contributed to mathematics achievement. The study's findings advance research into mutual influence processes, indicating that reciprocity may extend throughout the leader-teacher-student loop."

To that end, we performed multivariate analyzes, specifically structural equations modeling, on a database containing microdata from Prova Brasil and IDEB values. Results show that it is possible to measure leadership dimensions using these microdata. Based on the conceptual model developed, there is evidence that the relationships developed by the principal within the school have a greater effect on teachers' commitment to improve teaching and learning, thus indirectly affecting school performance. In addition, school principals have sought to exercise transformational leadership combined with pedagogical leadership, which represents a challenge for them, since it covers many knowledge areas."

Therefore, the enhancement of school leadership for student competency has become a key research topic. Leadership for learning is particularly relevant to these research developments. Leadership theories formulated in the past few decades center on the relationship between principal and teacher leadership and their influence on student performance. However, a research gap still exists in this area. This study explores the influence of principal and teacher leadership for learning on student core competency. This investigation reports a series of competency-based correlations involving principals, teachers, and students. Literature The ultimate goal of school-based education is the enhancement of student learning outcomes, and principal and teacher leadership should be directed toward this end. The joint investigation of principal and teacher leadership to understand their influence on school processes and student performance is central to modern school leadership research (e.g., Hallinger & Heck, 2010; Heck & Hallinger, 2009; Leithwood & Mascall, 2008; Louis et al., 2010; Spillane, 2006). These studies have primarily discussed the crucial influence of principal and teacher leadership on student learning and describe the intermediary role of teacher leadership. For example, Sebastian et al. (2017) studied the relationship of principal leadership with that of teachers to observe its influence on student performance; thus, they elucidated both the direct and indirect effects of leadership on student achievement. Their results indicated that principal leadership influences students in two respects. First, teacher leadership mediates this influence on students, and, second, teacher leadership mediates the influences of principal and teacher leadership on student performance. Another study by Sebastian et al. (2016) also reported that teacher leadership plays a key intermediary role between principal leadership and student achievement.. Methods The subjects of the study were teachers of elementary and junior high schools in Taiwan, and the survey was conducted by means of an online anonymous questionnaire. 200 schools were randomly selected, and the selected schools were requested to send the online anonymous questionnaire URL to all teachers of the school. A total of 1,615 questionnaires were recovered, including invalid questionnaires. After deducting invalid questionnaires, 1,490 valid questionnaires were finally recovered, and the effective rate of questionnaire recovery was 92.26%. Results and Discussion (1) According to survey results, participants had a moderate to high level of principal and teacher leadership in relation to learning and a moderate level of student core competency. Principal leadership for learning scores were the highest, indicating that principals were most influential in developing competency-based education. (2) Most studies have reported a low to nonsignificant direct influence of principal leadership on student learning (Bryk et al., 2010; Witziers et al., 2003); this is consistent with the low level of influence reported in this study. (3) This study found that teacher leadership for learning has a highly positive and direct influence on student core competency. The results of this study are consistent with those reported in the literature on teacher leadership. The primary purpose of teacher leadership is to strengthen the leadership behaviors for students to enhance learning effectiveness (Childs-Bowen et al., 2000; Danielson, 2006; Zheng & Chen, 2013), and the ultimate goal is to improve student learning performance (Carpenter & Sherretz, 2012; Hanuscin et al., 2012; Hunzicker, 2012; Vernon-Dotson & Floyd, 2012). These same principles inform competency-based education. (4) This study demonstrates that principal leadership for learning moderately affects student core competency; this influence is mediated by teacher leadership for learning and is higher than the direct influence of principal leadership for learning on student core competency. These results indicate that principals must develop student core competency through teachers, consistent with the findings of Leithwood et al. (2010). Through the principal and teacher leadership, schools can influence student learning performance. Teacher leadership is a key intermediary between principal leadership and student learning (Sebastian et al., 2016; Sebastian et al., 2017). Conclusions (1) Elementary and junior high school principal leadership for learning is a key promoter of competency-based education in 12-year basic education. (2) Elementary and junior high school principal leadership for learning exhibits a significant, positive, and strong direct influence on teacher leadership for learning. (3) Elementary and junior high school principal leadership for learning exhibits a significant, positive, and moderate to low direct influence on student core competency. (4) Elementary and junior high school teacher leadership for learning exhibits a significant, positive, and strong direct influence on student core competency. (5) Elementary and junior high school principal leadership for learning, through teacher leadership for learning, exhibits a significant, positive, and moderate indirect influence on student core competency. Suggestions (1) Educational administrative agencies should develop the knowledge and ability of leadership for learning as part of the competency-based education of primary and middle school principals. (2) Principals of elementary and junior high schools should establish a competency-based education system and strengthen teachers' recognition and investment in the system. (3) Educational research units should develop a complete educational administrative database reporting the implementation status of competency-based education to be used by elementary and junior high schools for secondary data analysis."

The sample for this study consisted of 590 teachers in 37 elementary schools in the Intermountain West of the United States. Teachers rated their principals' leadership style according to the Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire (Transformational Leadership) and the Principal Instructional Management Rating Scale (Instructional leadership). Student achievement was measured by a criterion referenced test. Hypotheses were tested using regression analysis. Results indicated that instructional leadership explained more of the variance in student achievement than did transformational leadership. Principals' leadership style tended to have a meaningful impact on student achievement beyond the impact of school context and principal demographics. Specific leadership functions associated with student achievement were also identified and reported. Conclusion, implications and limitations are also discussed."

Our motivation originates in the increasing trend in their share within the general population and the premise that this unique population may respond differently to school principal leadership style. Datasets on students' previous performance, students' background characteristics, teacher profiles, and school features were collected. In addition, a questionnaire on teachers' perceptions of their school principal's leadership style was distributed. Datasets were collected from 92 teachers who worked in special education needs public schools that specialized in conduct disorders. Using STATA software, we measured multilevel fixed-effects models. We found that the more the school principal is perceived as a transformational leader, the higher the students' performance. Additionally, secondary school advantaged students (i.e. having a high level of previous performance, high socioeconomic strata), who are taught by more educated teachers, exhibit higher performance compared with their counterparts. Based on our finding, we recommend that policy makers would consider assigning transformational leaders to low-performing schools. In addition, policy makers may want to allocate extra learning resources and to provide access to learning services to support the disadvantaged students' learning process."

A Latent Class Analysis of Principal Perception of Leadership,"Urick, A; Bowers, AJ",2014,EDUCATIONAL ADMINISTRATION QUARTERLY,10.1177/0013161x13489019,,"Purpose: Effective styles of principal leadership can help address multiple issues in struggling schools, such as low student achievement and high rates of teacher attrition. Although the literature has nominated certain ""idealized"" leadership styles as being more or less effective, such as transformational, instructional, and shared instructional leadership, we have little evidence about how principals may or may not choose to practice these styles across U.S. schools. Research Design: Latent class analysis was used to identify different types of principals across the United States. We analyzed the 1999-2000 Schools and Staffing Survey as it presents a unique opportunity to study the different types of U.S. principals since it contains leadership measures not found in other national surveys. A final sample of 7,650 public schools and principals was included in the analysis. Findings: Instead of idealized leadership styles signifying variations in practice, the differences between types of principals were defined by the degree of principal and teacher leadership. Further, the school and principal context, such as school size, urbanicity, accountability performance, and principal background, predicted the three significantly different principal types: controlling, frequent principal leadership; balkanizing, high degree of leadership shared with teachers; or integrating, frequent principal leadership as well as a high degree of leadership shared with teachers. Conclusions: These types suggest that principals simultaneously practice leadership behaviors associated with multiple leadership styles in accordance with their background and school context. These findings provide support for the use of more complex models to assess school leader effectiveness."

The purpose of this study was to identify and compare the antecedents fostering transformational leadership in the contexts of both the United States and China. This paper reviews and discusses the empirical studies of the last two decades, concentrating on the variables that are antecedent to transformational leadership mainly in the educational context, but also in public management, business and psychology. Results show that transformational leadership is related to three sets of antecedents, which include: (1) the leader's qualities (e.g., self-efficacy, values, traits, emotional intelligence); (2) organizational features (e.g., organization fairness); and (3) the leader's colleagues' characteristics (e.g., follower's initial developmental level). Some antecedents were common to both contexts, while other antecedents appeared to be national context specific.

Although all three instructional leadership dimensions moderately affected teacher efficacy, Manages the Instructional Program accounted for the largest share of variance, followed by School Climate and Mission. Moderation analysis identified significant effects of three national culture dimensions on principal instructional leadership and teacher efficacy. Specifically, this relationship was stronger in cultures that were higher in collectivism and power distance and lower in humane orientation. These findings reinforce the conclusion that instructional leadership can positively impact teachers' beliefs in their ability to succeed, and that school leadership is responsive to the cultural context. The authors recommend additional meta-analytic reviews of the relationship between instructional leadership and other teacher attitudes (e.g., commitment, trust, job satisfaction) and their mediating effects on high-impact teacher practices (e.g., instruction, professional learning, collaboration).

We conclude with key implications for policy and practice."

Moreover, there is a significant inconclusive body of literature on the most dominant leadership model (instructional (IL) and transformational (TL) in determining the coherence of school improvement and student academic achievement. Hence, the current study extended the knowledge by examining the impact of IL and TL on implementing the School Improvement Programme (SIP) in the Ethiopian context designed to foster students' academic performance. This study randomly sampled and surveyed 2880 public secondary school teachers and 70 principals. The study's findings suggested that school principals' personal information, gender, academic qualification, and leadership experience determine their leadership style, the coherence of SIP, and school performance. Unlike previous evidence, this study's findings shed light on the principals' IL and TL practice, which significantly impacted students' academic achievement through the mediating role of coherent SIP."

This has cultivated both policy and research interest in understanding how principals' leadership behaviors can leverage student outcomes both directly and indirectly through teachers. In this quest, three leadership models have become prominent due to their close relation to classroom instruction and learning: instructional, transformational, and distributed leadership. The current study aims to reveal the relationships between these leadership behaviors of principals and student outcomes as well as assess the mediating effect of teacher self-efficacy on this relationship. Utilizing meta-analytic structural equation modelling (MASEM) methodology, the study analyzes data from prior studies to offer a more comprehensive and holistic analysis of the complex relationships between the variables. The analysis of data from 90 studies showed that all three leadership behaviors affected student outcomes both directly and indirectly through teacher self-efficacy. They also had a moderate direct influence on teacher self-efficacy, while teacher self-efficacy had a moderate effect on student outcomes. These results reiterate the significance of principals' leadership for learning to facilitate student outcomes and suggest that the integrated practice of leadership in accordance with contextual requirements could leverage the effectiveness and improvement of schools."

The study examined the teachers' perceptions regarding using student achievement data in evaluation, finding mixed views about the inclusion of student scores, consistent with many recent studies on teacher evaluation reforms. Principal component analysis was conducted on the perception data and three factors emerged. The three factors were used in hierarchical multiple regression analyses and, in addition, three variables of teacher self-efficacy (i.e., efficacy for student engagement, efficacy for instructional strategies, and efficacy for classroom management) also were included in the analyses. The analyses found that (a) teachers' perceptions of their evaluation have a significant explanatory power on their job satisfaction, and (b) when their perceptions of evaluation are controlled, teachers' self-efficacy can explain additional variance in teachers' job satisfaction. Specifically, teachers' self-efficacy for student engagement was significantly predictive. Implications for educational policymakers and practitioners in light of enhancing teacher job satisfaction and developing rigorous teacher evaluation are discussed."

This is especially true in the wake of recent findings that instructional leadership has a greater impact on student learning. This study, going beyond simply evaluating whether these two modes of leadership complement or contradict each other, explores how they may intersect in complex and nuanced ways. Specifically, I examine the moderating effect of transformational leadership on the impact of instructional leadership on student outcomes. Research Design: A questionnaire, composed of items to measure instructional and transformational leadership, student outcomes, school background factors, and informant's demographic variables, was sent to the vice-principals in Hong Kong schools. Hierarchical regression analysis was used to factor out the effect of informants' personal and school factors on leadership perception and student outcomes in the testing of the moderating effect. Findings: With evidence drawn from 177 aided schools, this study confirms the moderating effect of transformational leadership through the identification of a disparity in the effect of instructional leadership on student outcomes corresponding to disparate levels of transformational leadership enactment in schools."

It identifies paths through which leadership explains differences in achievement and instruction between schools and differences in instruction among teachers within the same school. Research Design: Multilevel structural equation modeling was used to examine the relationships among principal leadership, school organizational structures, classroom instruction, and student grades and test gains on ACT's Education Planning and Assessment System. Measures of principal leadership and school organizational structures were collected from teacher surveys administered to all high school teachers in Chicago Public Schools in the 2006-2007 school years. Findings: Within schools, variation in classroom instruction is associated with principal leadership through multiple pathways, the strongest of which is the quality of professional development and coherence of programs. Between schools, differences in instruction and student achievement are associated with principal leadership only via the learning climate. This suggests that in high schools, establishing a safe, college-focused climate may be the most important leadership function for promoting achievement schoolwide."

In this research, we examined the relationship between integrated leadership and teacher professional learning and teacher practices in Turkey, where educational policy makers have recently introduced several school reform initiatives. More specifically, we aimed to examine the moderating function of transformational leadership in the relationship between instructional leadership and teacher practices, with an emphasis on the mediating role of teacher professional learning. Research Design: We conducted this study with a cross-sectional design and moderated mediation model. Data collected from 616 teachers working in a mix of primary and secondary schools in Turkey were analyzed using structural equation modeling and bootstrapping tests. Findings: We found evidence that transformational leadership acted as a moderator of the indirect effect of principal instructional leadership on teachers' instructional practices through teacher professional learning. Implications: This study adds to the accumulated body of knowledge on the effects of school leadership by concluding that the effect of instructional leadership on teacher learning and practice is contingent upon the extent to which principals enact transformational leadership. School principals who adopt a more comprehensive leadership approach that combines instructional leadership and transformational leadership practices can maximize their effects on student achievement through teacher learning, and better address the ever-growing demands of educational reforms."

The current study was conducted in China, where the workplace learning of teachers is embedded in a strong tradition of school-based, teacher learning practices such as the Master Teacher-Apprentice Bond and Teacher Research Groups. Purpose: The study investigated a mediated-effects model of principal instructional leadership and teacher learning. The model proposed principal time management skills and self-efficacy as antecedents of instructional leadership and teacher self-efficacy as a mediator of principal instructional leadership effects on the professional learning of teachers. Method: Survey data were collected from 3,414 teachers and 186 principals in 186 middle schools in Qingdao, China. Confirmatory factor analysis, structural equation modeling, and bootstrapping were used to analyze the multisource data. Results: The research confirmed a partial mediation model whereby principal instructional leadership evidenced moderate direct and indirect effects on teacher professional learning. Principal time management and self-efficacy exercised small effects on principal instructional leadership. Implications: The research adds to a growing body of research that affirms a positive relationship between principal leadership and teacher professional learning and emphasizes the importance of self-efficacy in shaping educator practice.

Thus far, little effort has been made to foster a transdisciplinary curricula beyond traditional organizational theories related to school culture and climate; learning sciences; and supervision. School leadership programs are currently inadequately preparing elementary leaders in rigorous pedagogies involving science education. Although the role of principals is often not discussed concerning science implementation in elementary education, principals play a critical role in science decision-making. In this study, the authors present a case study of one elementary principal who also served as an othermother. Othermothers have been described as those who share mothering responsibilities in Black communities. Through interview transcripts, field notes, and social network data, the authors examine how this othermother cared for her students and community by advocating for science instruction. By strategically navigating the socio-political and policy climate and drawing on her authentic relationships, this othermother was critical in implementing a science agenda for elementary science. Three themes that emerged from the data analysis are, (1) othermothers view science as a potential means to transform lives and fulfill the needs of the local community, (2) science policies (i.e., federal, state, and local) can limit the potential of the vision of science an othermother has for the community, (3) othermothers draw on their community to guide equitable science instruction. Overall, othermothers have visions for what science can do. However, they cannot counter the status quo individually. Collective action among educators in various roles is one means of moving an equity agenda concerning science education forward."

Research Methods: Empirical data were drawn from a 3-year mixed-methods national study (Impact Study) that investigated associations between the work of principals in effective and improving primary and secondary schools in England and student outcomes as defined (but not confined) by their national examination and assessment results over 3 years. The research began with a critical survey of the extant literature, followed by a national survey that explored principals' and key staff's perceptions of school improvement strategies and actions that they believed had helped foster better student attainment. This was complemented by multiperspective in-depth case studies of a subsample of 20 schools. Findings: The research provides new empirical evidence of how successful principals directly and indirectly achieve and sustain improvement over time through combining both transformational and instructional leadership strategies. The findings show that schools' abilities to improve and sustain effectiveness over the long term are not primarily the result of the principals' leadership style but of their understanding and diagnosis of the school's needs and their application of clearly articulated, organizationally shared educational values through multiple combinations and accumulations of time and context-sensitive strategies that are layered and progressively embedded in the school's work, culture, and achievements. Implications: Mixed-methods research designs are likely to provide finer grained, more nuanced evidence-based understandings of the leadership roles and behaviors of principals who achieve and sustain educational outcomes in schools than single lens quantitative analyses, meta-analyses, or purely qualitative approaches. The findings themselves provide support for more differentiated, context sensitive training and development for aspiring and serving principals."

Design/methodology/approach Multiple case study methodology is used to gather data from 12 principal supervisor/principal partnerships over a 16 month period in one Mid-Atlantic school district. Data sources included interviews, observational data and documents provided by participants in the study. Findings In productive principal supervisor/principal partnerships, findings demonstrated that the principal supervisor and the principal each brought specific antecedent characteristics to their partnership and each made contributions to the development of a productive partnership during their collaborative work. When these partnership qualities were present, principal supervisors and principals engaged in joint work, leading to robust changes in principals' instructional leadership practice. Research limitations/implications - This study examined the work of principals and principal supervisors in one large Mid-Atlantic school district. Practical implications - Findings from this study have implications for districts' assignments of principal supervisors, principal supervisor/principal selection and professional development of principal supervisors. Further, districts should create the conditions for principal supervisors and principals to establish learning-focused professional partnerships in three stages, culminating in the engagement of joint work for improvement to facilitate principals' changes in instructional leadership practice. Originality/value Findings from this study illustrate the value of establishing a learning-focused partnership between principal supervisors and principals in three stages to facilitate robust stages in principals' instructional leadership practice. A new conceptual framework displays the stages of partnership development that occur in productive principal/principal supervisor partnerships."

It acknowledges that leadership responsibilities are shared across stakeholders, inviting wider sources of leadership. If leadership for learning conceptualizes leadership as an organization-wide practice beyond that of an individual (e.g. the school principal), its measurement must accordingly invite perceptions and experiences of diverse stakeholders at multiple levels. Focusing solely on principals' or teachers' leadership perceptions is problematic since it fails to capture the unique lived realities teachers or principals experience concerning leadership enactment. It also limits the capacity to examine whether and how these multiple perspectives exert same or divergent impacts on staff development, school culture, and student learning. Thus, this study employed leadership for learning as its theoretical framework and rigorous multilevel factor analysis techniques to examine the extent to which individual teachers, teachers collectively, and principals show distinct perceptions of leadership practices. Four-fold cross-validation multilevel factor analysis revealed conceptual distinctions in how the three entities experience leadership practices distributed across the school. We also present implications for educational leadership research, practices, and policy."

The collected data underwent three stages of analysis: sorting, coding, and categorizing. The findings revealed three key areas in which the principal's instructional leadership influences the school's middle leadership: the expectations of middle leaders, the selection and appointment of middle leaders, and the hierarchical structure of middle leaders within the school. These findings highlight the comprehensive impact of instructional leadership on various organizational aspects of middle leadership in schools."

With this end in mind, we have employed a SEM to analyze the correlations between principals' leadership styles, teacher classroom leadership, and teacher motivation. The study's sample group consisted of 325 teachers employed in primary education institutions. The Leadership Style Scale, Teacher Classroom Leadership Scale, and Teacher Professional Motivation Scale were used to collect data. We found that although teachers' classroom leadership levels were higher than principals' leadership levels, principals' leadership had a higher direct impact on teacher motivation than did teacher classroom leadership and that quality interaction both in school and in the classroom is the single most influential component on teacher classroom leadership and motivation. Our findings suggest that the primary determinant of teacher classroom leadership and motivation lies in the quality of interactions within both the school and classroom environments. These results underscore the significance of principals' leadership roles in current scholarly discussions on shared leadership in educational settings and on the conceptualization of teacher leadership. Consequently, sharing leadership does not diminish its impact but rather amplifies it. Nevertheless, while promoting shared leadership and empowering teachers are indeed virtuous endeavors in and of themselves, principal leadership is one of the most influential factors teacher motivation."

Important findings are concluded as follows: (1) Teacher perceptions of principal leadership, teacher leadership for learning, teacher trust in principal and school academic emphasis all reached moderately high level. Teacher leadership for learning was ranked as the top, followed by teacher trust in principal. (2) Among the demographic variables, teachers with formal administrative post or not was found to exert significant influence on the aforementioned teacher perceptions. (3) The effect of principal leadership on teacher leadership for learning was moderated by teacher trust and academic emphasis. In other words, principal effect on teacher leadership was more vivid in schools where teachers had higher degree of trust in principals, and less evidently in schools with stronger extent of academic emphasis. The study features itself with cultural implication for its presenting weaker significance of academic emphasis than that found in the western context."

The standard of academic achievement in Kuwait's public schools has been declining over the years, which merits consideration of private sector's business models to the public education sector, in order to transform the sector, and improve the public schools' outcomes. Transformational leadership, if adopted by school heads is thus considered to influence students' outcomes. The paper contributes to our understanding of the role of transformational leadership and its influence on staff and students' achievement, from a developing country's context-Kuwait.

A recent meta-analysis by Robinson and colleagues identified principal practices that shape teacher professional development experiences in schools as the highest impact path used by instructional leaders. The purpose of this paper is to examine relationships between principal leadership, dimensions of school capacity, and teacher professional learning in 32 Hong Kong primary schools. Design/methodology/approach - The study employed a cross-sectional research design and quantitative methods to analyze teacher perceptions of principal leadership and key school conditions. The research employed hierarchical linear regression analysis to explore survey data collected from a sample of 970 teachers. The surveys covered a range of principal leadership and school capacity dimensions, as well as a measure of teacher professional learning. Findings - Results indicated that multiple dimensions of principal leadership made significant contributions to both school capacity and teacher professional learning. The presence of cooperation, trust, communication, support for students, and alignment, coherence, and structure in schools also affected teacher professional learning. Research limitations/implications - These findings contribute to the global discourse on leadership for learning. The study addresses the need established by multiple scholars (e.g. Leithwood, Hallinger, Heck, Robinson, Witziers) for research that further illuminates ""paths"" and ""intermediate targets"" through which leadership impacts teaching and learning. The findings elaborate on the means by which leadership can enhance school capacities that directly impact teacher classroom practice and student learning. Consistent with other scholarly research (e.g. Bryk and Schneider, Louis and colleagues, Sahphier and King) the findings also point toward the importance of establishing selected workplace conditions (e.g. trust, cooperation, communication) as a foundation for fostering teacher professional learning. Practical implications - The study reinforces the finding from other studies that it is productive for principals to foster an environment aimed at enhancing teacher professionalism. The study also highlights the potentially dysfunctional consequences that can arise from competing system-level initiatives aimed at increasing monitoring and teacher accountability and fostering teacher professionalism. Originality/value - The study contributes to a small but growing body of leadership effects research conducted in non-Western societies. As such the study offers insights with relevance for understanding leadership processes in other Asian and non-Western cultures."

Four leadership styles outlined in the path-goal theory and five key performance indicators (KPIs) of teacher job performance were chosen for the present research. Numerous prior studies have documented this subject. However, they reported on teacher job performance as a single unit. Therefore, a concerted effort was required to examine the effects of adopted principal leadership styles on each of the five key performance indicators of teacher job performance. A total of 253 middle management personnel took part in this empirical study. The correlation findings from the structural equation modeling revealed that the directive leadership style had a significant effect on teacher job performance in the studied schools, followed by the supportive and achievement-oriented leadership styles. Conversely, although participative leadership was identified as a significant predictor, it was not considered a promising predictor of teacher job performance. This research was conducted in a non-Western culture, where directive leadership is beneficial for encouraging teacher job performance; this claim is greatly supported by the available rigorous literature."

The objectives of this article are to (a) better understand how teachers' collective decision making and principal's leadership are related to the schools' culture homogeneity and (b) test the moderating role of the schools' culture homogeneity on the relationship between four cultural scales and the schools' mathematics achievement. Method: The sample of this study consisted of 2,595 students nested in 52 schools and 125 classes from the French-speaking community of Belgium. Students performed two mathematics achievement tests and answered a self-reported questionnaire on their backgrounds. All the teachers (n = 817) of the 52 schools answered a self-reported questionnaire dealing with the principal's leadership, school culture, and teacher collegiality. Hypotheses are tested using correlation, regression, and hierarchical regression analyses. Research Findings: First, it was found that culture homogeneity is positively associated with (a) the principal's transformational leadership (TL) and (b) the teachers' collective decision making relative to pedagogical aspects. Second, it was shown that the impact of TL on culture homogeneity is partially mediated by teachers' collective decision making. Third, the analyses found no moderation effect of culture homogeneity on the relationship between cultural values and students' achievement but did show partial evidence of such an effect in specific groups of schools (with low or high socioeconomic status composition). Implications: This study provides a deeper understanding of how social arrangements and leadership processes within schools contribute to the emergence of collective cultural values. But the results also shed light on the weak associations between cultural values and student achievement, even when considering an appropriate definition and conceptualization of the school culture.."

The authors examined the following research questions: does the school context influence the principal's leadership? When the influences of the school context are controlled for, does the principal's leadership influence the process variables related to teachers and educational climate? Design/methodology/approach - The research questions are analysed in a multilevel context by developing two models regarding the hypothesized relationships between the study variables. With the use of multilevel structural equation modelling techniques the models were empirically tested on data from Italian teachers and students from a sample of schools in Italy. The database include 1,566 teachers from 47 schools of different types and levels from the Autonomous Province of Trento. Findings - In those schools which have the highest leadership scores, the authors also find a greater degree of job satisfaction among the teachers, higher levels of self-efficacy of teachers, and a better educational climate, which is more respectful of the basic rules of coexistence existing within the school. An interesting additional element is that the positive relationship between the exercise of leadership and the process variables related to academic success is still present, even if the effects of the school context are controlled for. Research limitations/implications - It should be observed that the results of this study, particularly due to the non-representative nature of the sample considered, should be considered as preliminary evidence that will require further confirmation, and which cannot be immediately generalized. The results obtained can be influenced by the specific territorial area in which this search has been conducted. The Autonomous Province of Trento, from the rest of Italy, is characterized by a highly centralized education system, with a relative homogeneity of the conditions of the context in which schools have achieved so widespread high levels of student learning. Originality/value - When studying leadership it is important to consider the school context, particularly the role of the initial level of learning of the students, as this study shows that in schools where the prior knowledge of students is greater, teachers are generally more satisfied with their job and they report a better educational environment.

Period 2 included research aimed at understanding what strong principal leadership entailed, including the development and testing of more coherent models of such leadership. While instructional and transformational leadership models were prominent during Periods 1 and 2, Period 3 research invested heavily in conceptions of leadership distribution. Early research about 'social justice leadership' appeared during this period and eventually flourished during Period 4. While principals were an active focus through all Periods, the leadership of others gradually dominated ELR and accounted for the broader leadership theme found in all four periods. The results point to the evolutionary nature of ELR development, which eventually produced a relatively robust knowledge base. Experiences with the COVID-19 pandemic suggest that crises such as this might prompt more revolutionary orientations in the ELR field."

Results indicated a significant omnibus effect for the general factor only, with highly qualified principals holding significantly more positive beliefs about how parents, teachers, and students feel about their school's emphasis on academic success. Further analyses at the item level indicated that ""teacher expectations"" were the single item presenting a DIF effect with highly qualified principals having stronger beliefs about their teacher's expectations of student success over and above the latent factor mean. Results are discussed on how they inform educational policy and practice."

While various styles, such as transformational, instructional, shared instructional, point to the similar measures of high organizational quality, the inconsistency in how these styles are defined and relate make it unclear how principals systematically improve schools. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach - This study used the 1999-2000 schools and staffing survey, n = 8,524 of US principals, since it includes a nationally representative sample of administrators who responded to a comprehensive set of leadership measures around a time of school restructuring reforms. Confirmatory factor analysis was used to identify different styles, and to measure the extent of their relationship. These factors were used to test a theory about why principals practice each of these styles to a different degree based on levels of shared instructional leadership. Findings - Based on the theoretical framework, principals should have a similar high influence over resources, safety and facilities regardless of degree of shared instructional leadership since these tasks address foundational school needs. However, principal and teacher influence over these resources differed across levels of shared instructional leadership more than principal-directed tasks of facilitating a mission, supervising instruction and building community. Originality/value - Differences in the practice of styles by shared instructional leadership did not fit changing, higher ordered needs as theorized instead seemed to vary by a hierarchy of control, the way in which principals shared influence with teachers."

Research has proved that school leaders can make a difference in school and student performance. Thus, the leadership style and the role of principals are crucial in directing their schools towards better performance. Central Colleges in Sri Lanka as secondary and collegiate levels of schools have shown higher performances in the past, but there is evidence that the performances of the Central Colleges are declining at present. Having explored the meaning of school performances, this study identifies characteristics of effective leadership and examines the impact of the effective leadership style on the school performance of Central Colleges in the Western Province of Sri Lanka. Based on quantitative research methods, primary data were collected using a structured questionnaire from a sample of 357 teachers using a random sampling method. Descriptive and inferential statistics were used to analyse the data. Based on the analysis five characteristics of effective leadership were identified explaining 81.4% variance in school performance and these characteristics significantly and positively affect school performance. Thus, school performances could be improved if principals are inclusive, innovative, resourceful, and thoughtful of others, encourage their teachers to get the best results, and create a stimulating environment for improving performance as there is a lack of research specifically, exploring the qualities of effective leadership style, this study filled an apparent knowledge gaps in prior research concerning effective leadership characteristics with empirical data."

In this context, the purpose of the study is to find out the relationships between teachers' perceptions about four-frame leadership orientations of principals and collective teacher efficacy. 452 primary school teachers participated in the study in which Leadership Orientation Scale and Collective Teacher Efficacy Scale were used. The teacher perceptions showed that leadership frames preferred by school principals are, respectively, structural, political, human resource and symbolic frame. It was also found that the collective teacher efficacy perceptions of teachers were influenced by seniority of teachers and settlement location of schools.

Part of the problem is the unreliability of many measures of leadership quality. In addition, the field has been dominated until quite recently by abstract theories of leadership which are not closely aligned to the specific work of educational leaders. While recent research by economists has confirmed that school leadership makes a significant difference to student outcomes, their analyses beg the question of how these effects are produced. In this article we address this question by updating the first author's 2008 model of student-centred leadership which identified the average impact of five sets of leadership practices on student outcomes. We argue that future research programmes should develop theories and measures of educational leadership which are based on expert judgments of the quality of enactment of these five sets of practices, and test their impact on a wider range of student outcomes."

The Organizational Leadership Model hypothesizes four distinct conditions of school leadership, and the analysis investigates the relationship between teacher, principal, and school outcomes; school descriptors; and a school's category in the Organizational Leadership Model. Theoretical Orientation: Ogawa and Bossert's conception of leadership as an organizational quality serves as the theoretical foundation of this study, along with contemporary theories of distributed leadership, influence as leadership, and measurement of leadership. Data Source: This study draws teacher, principal, and school restricted-use data from the 2003-2004 Schools and Staffing Survey. The sample consists of 7,950 schools, their principals, and a random sample of teachers from each school. The school is the primary unit of analysis. Analysis: This study is conducted in two phases. In Phase 1, the Organizational Leadership Model (OLM) is tested for its ability to discriminate between teacher, principal, and school outcomes through a series of one-way ANOVA models. In Phase 2, a series of brr weighted ordered logit models explores the predictive power of school descriptors in determining the OLM category of schools. Findings: The analysis finds evidence that the Organizational Leadership Model is a robust measure of leadership as an organizational quality that effectively captures differences in school leadership contexts at the level of principals' and teachers' perceptions of their influence that precede task-oriented behaviors. Additionally, the study highlights the troubling relationship between schools serving high-need populations and those typified by low levels of school leadership. Implications for Research and Practice: The article identifies several avenues for future research to extend inquiry on the potential of the Organizational Leadership Model to develop additional nuance in discriminating between relationships among school contexts, leadership conditions, and teacher, principal, and school outcomes. The article further urges those implicit in maintaining the status quo of poor leadership accountability in schools, including those in the research community, to seek interventions at the level of principal and teacher perceptions of and professional standards for their practice."

Research Methods: The universe of the research in the relational screening model is the 3648 teachers working in the secondary education institutions in Van province in the 2017-2018 academic year. 558 teachers, who were determined by the stratified sampling method, formed the sample of the research. Findings: According to research findings, teachers think that school principals usually show strategic leadership qualities. According to the teachers, school principals are generally in the dimension of strategic leadership, transformational applications, managerial applications and political applications, and in terms of ethical applications, they always demonstrate strategic leadership characteristics. Teachers' organizational commitment was found to be moderate in the study. Teachers' organizational commitment was found moderate level, at a low level in the compliance sub-dimension, a low level in the internalization sub-dimension, and a moderate level in the identification sub-dimension.

Learning theory elaborates that such support for principals demands that supervisors take a teaching-and-learning approach - which the authors define as consistently using particular strategies that are characteristic of high quality teachers and mentors across various apprenticeship settings - to their work with principals on their instructional leadership. Prior research on leadership supports these shifts but does not examine the conditions under which principal supervisors are able to persist and grow in taking a teaching-and-learning approach specifically. What are those conditions? The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach This paper addresses that question through a re-examination of data from two studies with socio-cultural learning theory as the conceptual framework. The authors primarily use observation data (approximately 760 hours), supplemented by 344 interviews and reviews of hundreds of documents. Findings Contrary to extant research the authors did not associate high quality outside coaching with the positive cases of principal supervision. Nor did hiring principal supervisors with requisite prior knowledge explain why some principal supervisors regressed and grew. Findings underscore the importance of supervisors of principal supervisors (SPSs) being principal supervisors' main mentors and principal supervisors not over-relying on others for assistance but actively leading their own learning, especially through work with colleagues and protecting their time themselves. Originality/value This analysis distinguishes conditions that support principal supervisors in taking a teaching-and-learning approach to their work with principals. The authors elaborate key roles for chief academic officers and others who supervise principal supervisors typically overlooked in policy and research on district leadership. Findings reinforce the importance of mentoring to learning and also district leaders serving as main mentors for each other, rather than relying on outside coaching."

Besides the longstanding interest in educational leadership as a key element in teacher and student performance, there is a growing interest in strategic human resource management (SHRM) in the educational sector. However, few educational studies link educational leadership to SHRM. In particular, this study examines the relationship between principals' instructional and transformational leadership style and principals' strategic and HR orientation in configuring HR practices for new teachers. Data were gathered using a mixed methods approach, including interviews with 75 principals as well as an online survey of 1058 teachers in Flemish primary education. Qualitative interview data were transformed and analysed together with the quantitative survey data using logistic regression and ANOVA analyses. The results indicate that both instructional and transformational leadership is associated with the strategic orientation of principals. The HR orientation, on the other hand, is not reflected in the principals' leadership style. Recommendations for further research in this area are discussed."

Research Methods: The schools were selected from a geographically stratified sample of public middle schools in a state in the southeastern United States. Multiple linear regression was used to identify schools performing better than expected considering their levels of poverty and other school-related factors. The final three schools, one from each geographic region, showed steady increases in academic achievement and school climate following the arrival of their principals. Data were primarily collected from interviews with principals, teaching and nonteaching staff, and parents using protocols adapted from the International Successful School Principalship Project. Findings: The findings explicate the large degree to which the leadership practices and beliefs that influenced student achievement in these schools were adapted to and commensurate with each school's immediate context. Furthermore, they illustrate how principals used these practices to institutionalize school-wide reform efforts as vehicles for leading change within their schools. Implications: The findings substantiate research on successful school leadership in high-needs middle schools. They also extend this research by examining the way core transformational and instructional leadership practices can be adapted to suit various school contexts and institutionalize school-wide reform efforts to enhance student learning. Further research is required to understand how principals decide to adapt their leadership practices, and how aspiring leaders can best learn to do so."

The training developed for this purpose included a series of management workshops with combined coaching. On the basis of a quasi -experimental study with an experimental and control group, the effectiveness of the intervention was examined from several perspectives. The results of the study make it clear that in the 29 schools examined, ""transformational leadership"" is the dominant leadership behaviour of the school leaders. In addition, it was found that teachers (N = 607) assessed the leadership behaviour of the school leaders less positively than the members of the school leadership (N = 101). From the point of view of the school principals, several positive effects on leadership can be identified, which can be traced back to the training programme."

Given that multiple school functions are needed to serve society at different levels, the required roles in school leadership are inevitably multiple, diverse and demanding. In past decades, many studies have been conducted with a focus on some aspects of leadership functions and processes. Unfortunately, there is a lack of a typology of school leadership to map out comprehensive leadership profiles and understand their multiple characteristics for leading school development and effectiveness in a fast-changing environment. Based on the framework of multiple school effectiveness, this paper aims to propose a typology of multiple school leadership that can provide a new, comprehensive way to re-conceptualize the multiple nature and characteristics of school leadership in a complicated context. Depending on the rationalities, concerns, actions, outcomes and contexts of leadership in practice, the typology of multiple school leadership may include six models: technological leadership, economic leadership, social leadership, political leadership, cultural leadership, and learning leadership. Within this typology, new possibilities and approaches to school leadership can be drawn for research, practice and development towards the future."

The main objective of the study is thus to formulate achievement strategies to improve the educative centre and the educational community at several levels: as individuals, as groups and as an organization. To this aim we conducted a descriptive research with a non-experimental design by the poll method, through the implementation of the 'Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire by Bass and Avolio - MLQ' instrument, administered to teachers and principals of technical-technological programmes of the Cooperative University of Colombia. Results show that the elements of Transformational Leadership are predominant over the other types of Leadership. They thus emerge as the key element to strengthen, through individual training processes and organizational improvement strategies, in order to achieve optimal organizational results.

Research Design: The methodology involved an analysis of findings from 27 published studies of the relationship between leadership and student outcomes. Vie first meta-analysis, including 22 of the 27 studies, involved a comparison of the effects of transformational and instructional leadership on student outcomes. The second meta-analysis involved a comparison of the effects of five inductively derived sets of leadership practices on student outcomes. Twelve of the studies contributed to this second analysis. Findings: The first meta-analysis indicated that the average effect of instructional leadership on student outcomes was three to four times that of transformtional leadership. Inspection of the survey items used to measure school leadership revealed five sets of leadership practices or dimensions: establishing goals and expectations; resourcing strategically; planning, coordinating, and evaluating teaching and the curriculum; promoting and participating in teacher learning and development, and ensuring an orderly and supportive environment. The second meta-analysis revealed strong average effects for the leadership dimension involving promoting and participating in teacher learning and development and moderate effects for the dimensions concerned with goal setting and planning, coordinating, and evaluating teaching and the curriculum. Conclusions and Implications for Research and Practice: The comparisons between transformational and instructional leadership and between the five leadership dimensions suggested that the more leaders focus their relationships, their work, and their learning on the core business of teaching and learning, the greater their influence oil student outcomes. The article concludes with a discussion of the need for leadership research and practice to be more closely linked to the evidence on effective teaching and effective teacher learning.

data_rawWoS_2025-08-23_PrincipalTL_StudentAchievement_179.ris,ris,Connection Between Taiwanese Research on School Leadership and Global Scholarship: A Bibliometric Review,"Pan, HLW; Chen, WY",2021,JOURNAL OF RESEARCH IN EDUCATION SCIENCES,10.6209/jories.202106_66(2).0006,,"1. Background Systematic reviews may inform public policies and contribute to the building of a knowledge base. However, reviews of school leadership research are relatively rare in Taiwan. This study conducted a bibliometric review to analyze journal papers by Taiwanese scholars in the Scopus database published in the previous 20 years. The focus was to examine the connection between Taiwanese and global research on school leadership. 2. Research questions On the basis of the research background, four research questions were proposed: (1) What is the volume and growth trajectory of Taiwanese school leadership research? (2) What is the international visibility of Taiwanese school leadership research as revealed through citation analysis? (3) What are the main topics covered by Taiwanese school leadership research and how do they correspond to the global trend? (4) What is the intellectual structure of Taiwanese school leadership research and how do it connect with the global literature? 3. Theoretical framework (1) Intellectual development of school leadership research The theory movement in the 1950s and 1960s highlighted the development of educational administration research. Griffiths (1959) categorized these theories into four groups: social system and role theory, leadership theory, decision theory, and organizational theory. In the 1970s, contingency theory, which emphasizes the influence of context on leadership, was proposed. With the growing interest in school effectiveness and school reform, the organizational perspective was applied to investigate school leadership. Instructional leadership was also emphasized from then on. In the 1990s, other leadership approaches such as transformational leadership, moral leadership, and distributed leadership became popular in school leadership research. With the power paradigm shifting from a heroic view of leaders to a more dispersed view of power, distributed leadership and teacher leadership were also highly recognized. In response to the international context, leadership for learning, which includes elements of instructional leadership, transformational leadership, and shared leadership, has gained global attention in the new millennium. (2) Retrospective view of school leadership research Systematic reviews did not appear in the field of educational administration until the 1980s. EPPI-Centre (2012) indicated the four key features of systematic reviews. First, a high quality systematic review is explicit and is conducted using transparent methods. Second, it follows a standard set of stages. Third, the review is accountable, replicable, and updateable. Fourth, users should be involved to ensure reports are relevant and useful. The elements of reviews include the central topics of interest, guiding questions, and goals; a conceptual perspective for guiding the review's selection, evaluation, and interpretation of the studies; sources and types of data; data evaluation and analysis; and the major results of the review (Hallinger, 2014). However, according to Hallinger's study in 2014, only eight reviews met these criteria. Of the eight studies, some used critical synthesis, some adopted meta-analysis, and some employed both. In recent years, network analysis, data mining, and bibliometric analysis are increasingly being applied in systematic reviews. In addition to a greater diversity in methods, the regions under review have expanded from the United States and United Kingdom to many other regions. This development can be attributed to Hallinger's effort to initiate international collaboration to build the knowledge base of educational leadership in Asia. Because of the growing interest in the academic development in non-Western countries, he promoted the use of systematic reviews to examine studies in Asia, Africa, Saudi Arabia, and Central and South America, which resulted in more than 30 systematic reviews on educational leadership and management. A wide range of research topics is a prominent feature of educational leadership and management research. Five topics that have gained frequent attention are social justice, female leadership, school leadership preparation and development, trust, and instruction and instructional leadership. The following are the topics of frontier research in this field: principal, school leadership, and student achievement; distributed leadership, instructional leadership, teacher learning, accountability, school improvement, school reform, and leadership development; and race, justice, and urban education. In Taiwan, research reviews on educational leadership are scant. According to Lin's (2000) review, only a few studies have focused on the impact of principals on students. Pan's (2010) review indicated that of all the educational leadership studies in government-funded projects and journals, 70% of the topics were related to principals' leadership styles and behaviors. The distribution of the research topics was not sufficiently diversified to reflect global academic development. 4. Research method This study used bibliometric analysis on the Scopus database to analyze Taiwanese school leadership research. The review process was based on the steps of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) developed by Moher et al. (2009). After the process of screening, identification, eligibility determination, and inclusion, 95 papers were included for analysis. Descriptive analysis, citation analysis, co-occurrence analysis of keywords, and co-citation analysis were conducted to address the research questions. 5. Research findings The study had the following three key findings: (1) Concerning the volume of publication in journals, the first English paper on Taiwanese school leadership research did not appear until 2001. Although the promotion of the world university rankings and the launch of the Top University Project have changed the trend of solely using Chinese for academic writing, the number of English studies on school leadership remains limited. Moreover, only 14.7% of papers are published in the core journals of education leadership and management. (2) A citation analysis revealed that the international visibility of Taiwanese school leadership research is low. The average number of papers of the 10 most cited Taiwanese scholars is 3.5, and they have been cited an average of 45.2 times. The number of citations of Taiwanese scholars is 3.33 times less than that of African educational leadership research and 11.78 times less than that of research on three emerging regions. (3) The research topics selected by Taiwanese scholars may highlight international academic development; however, some underdeveloped topics remain such as social justice leadership, organizational theory, institutional theory, and social capital. The current co-citation analysis revealed the four schools of thought of Taiwanese school leadership, namely leadership for learning, distributed forms of leadership, leadership behavior and its impact, and social network. 6. Contributions Systematic reviews on school leadership are scarce in Taiwan. The present study conducted a bibliometric analysis to examine the development and features of Taiwanese school leadership literature which is innovative in the research method. The connection between Taiwanese studies on school leadership research and global scholarship has seldom been addressed in relevant research. The current analysis presents the development of Taiwanese school leadership and its connection with global trends, providing critical insights and directions for future research on school leadership in Taiwan."

Results indicate that years of service as a school principal and academic qualification were two significant factors of leadership skill. The factors predicted 24.9% of the overall leadership skill. However, there was no significant difference between the male and female principals on leadership skill. In terms of leadership domain, the principals possessed high instructional and cultural leadership skills and low educational management and organizational management leadership skills. The findings imply that school principals should be provided ample opportunities for self-professional development to improve the quality of their leadership skills. (C) 2013 The Authors.

Hierarchical regression analyses were employed to analyze the potential moderating effects of interest.FindingsThere were interactive effects of principals' distributed leadership and school contextual factors on teachers' adoption of leadership roles. The impact of principals' distributed leadership on teacher leadership was amplified in environments marked by elevated levels of trust relations and reduced academic emphasis.Practical implicationsThis study uncovers the critical prerequisites principals must address to cultivate teacher leadership. To effectively encourage heightened teacher engagement in leadership, principals must place a premium on nurturing trusting relations with their teaching staff and acknowledge that the influence of their leadership might be lessened in an environment where credentialism holds sway.Originality/valueThe exploration into faculty trust and academic emphasis yields insights into the conducive conditions for principals to foster teacher leadership.

Parallel to the interviews the OCAI questionnaire was distributed to the teachers, employees and principals to find out the organizational culture in the schools. The results of the OCAI questionnaires show that the clan culture is the most dominant one, the market culture is the second and the adhocracy culture is the third. The results of the interviews show that the principals' most dominant leadership style is the transformational leadership style with the use of the transactional leadership style in small proportions. The principals perceive the schools as big families; people help and support each other which express the clan culture. The principals use ""give and take equation"" which expresses the market culture. The principals encourage competitions which expresses the adhocracy culture. This shows similarities in the results of both the interviews and the OCAI questionnaires. The intended contribution of the research is to raise the awareness of the principal and the teachers to the principals' leadership styles and to the organizational culture, and to think of ways to improve them.

School principals are expected to demonstrate proficiency when performing leadership and management roles in schools. Based on the fact that no certificate for principalship exists, newly appointed principals rely on their teaching experience to fulfil the responsibilities of the position. Gronn's theory advocating leadership as a career was used as a lens to analyse the data. In this qualitative study we used interviews and document verification to understand how new appointees perceived their new roles as school leaders and managers. The findings imply that beginner principals regard themselves as ill-prepared to lead and manage schools in their early years of appointment. Their perceptions were that they lacked leadership and management experience in the areas of curriculum, human resources, school finance, stakeholder relations and interpretation of legislation. Beginner principals viewed these as challenges for their leadership and management expertise. From the study we concluded that teachers needed to be exposed to leadership and management responsibilities and that newly appointed principals needed to be trained before they assumed their new positions."

Employing a mixed methods approach, the research combines quantitative survey data (N = 133) and qualitative interviews (N = 12) to examine variables related to initial guidance (general support, learning and sharing with colleagues, mentoring) and the supportive school context (sense of belonging at school, cooperation, clear goals and support, appreciative school leadership). The findings demonstrate that key elements within the supportive school context-particularly sense of belonging, cooperation, clear goals, and appreciative leadership-have a positive influence on teacher retention. Conversely, general support within initial guidance exhibits a comparatively weaker predictive value. The qualitative analysis reveals inconsistencies in the provision and quality of initial guidance support across schools, which adversely impacts teachers' professional integration and job satisfaction. The study concludes that the implementation of structured support systems, well-defined goals, and appreciative leadership are critical for improving retention rates. These findings underscore the necessity for schools to adopt both individualized and institutional strategies to address early-career teacher attrition effectively."

We collected data from semistructured interviews with the principals and three other leaders from each of their respective schools. Through our findings, we illustrate the varying degree to which each principal viewed the leaders' existing capacities, structured their leadership learning opportunities, guided their reflections, and assessed their learning in the context of leadership practice. An important finding was that the way the principals viewed leadership development and saw other leaders as learners themselves appeared to influence the way they developed other leaders' personal capacities."

The study is designed according to a relational survey model, and it consists of 370 teachers working in 20 schools in Selcuklu, Karatay, and Meram districts of Konya, Turkey. The leadership style scale of school principals (LSSSP), the scale for school culture (SSC), and the scale of the organizational image (SOI) were used as data collection tools. Pearson's correlation, regression, and path analysis were used for analyzing data in addition to descriptive statistics. It was found that school principals manifest transformational leadership characteristics, the perception of school culture by the teachers is strong and the perception of the organizational image by the teachers is medium. It was also found that there are significant relationships between leadership styles, the school culture, and organizational image, along with the leadership style of school principals, which significantly predicted school culture, and school culture, which significantly predicted organizational image. School culture has a mediator effect on both leadership styles and the organizational image. This is due to the realization of the leadership styles that have an important role in developing an organizational image, through school culture. This research offers the presumptions that leadership manifested by the principal creates a positive effect on the members of the organization and contributes to the formation of strong school culture, in addition to leadership and school culture making a positive contribution to the organizational image of the educational institution."

Thus, the pressures to improve the outcomes of education in institutions have directed the focus to the realization level of the leadership of schools. Although, instructional leadership involves learner autonomy, it is found that level of demonstrating leadership and learner autonomy behaviours is higher than it has been considered as the teachers in our institutions and administrators believe such behaviours are necessary in class to foster learning. Those who apply instructional leadership techniques create better learning atmosphere and improve themselves professionally compared to others who are lacking such skills. This helps to the improvement of these institutions and teachers who are willing to work in collaboration. However, this must follow support of peers and evaluation of self and others, in order to see if these are applied correctly. This research is done to reveal the opinions of teachers and managers and their past experiences in such cases. Pre-test and post-test were applied in the study and the results were evaluated. Moreover, the pros and cons of instructional leadership techniques used in educational institutions were identified. In this study, some recommendations are made to create better learning environment, more democratic and comfortable atmosphere supporting all educators and learners as well as their personal growth that would enable them to have a say while giving vital decisions."

The authors also investigated how the frequency of effective leadership practices related to the strength of district support and the extent of school problems and student poverty. Finally, the authors examined the contribution of exemplary leadership preparation to variations in school improvement progress and school effectiveness climate. Research Design: The study, using survey research conducted in 2005, compared 65 principals who had graduated from one of four selected exemplary leadership preparation programs to a national sample of 111 principals. The authors used structural equation modeling to find the best fit. Findings: Participation in an exemplary leadership preparation program was significantly associated with learning about effective leadership and engaging in these practices, particularly where stronger preparation program and internship quality existed. Frequent use of effective leadership practices was positively associated with school improvement progress and school effectiveness climate. Taken together, exemplary leadership preparation had a positive but mediated influence on variations in school improvement progress and school effectiveness climate; the relationship was even stronger when focusing on preparation program and internship quality measures. Conclusions: Faculty investments in preparation program and internship quality will positively contribute to the leadership knowledge of graduates and their leadership practices and school improvement progress. These results yield significant implications for policy makers, universities, and other providers of leadership preparation."

The conceptualization of educational leadership among researchers so far had been found to vary according to different contexts and situations. Theoretical perspectives associated with educational leadership have either approached the concept from dimensions working outside the school or from dimensions reflecting the personality trait of the principal. There is an urgent need to shift the focus of attention toward understanding educational leadership through an interactive collaboration of these dimensions. Specifically, in school contexts, the phenomenon of educational leadership was explored and theorized from one perspective only, giving less space to have multidisciplinary view, which need to be revived in terms of contexts and associated metaphors of educational leadership. Although the importance of educational leadership has been widely acknowledged, its role still remains unheeded in various sections of education. The purpose of the review, thus, is to gain macro-level insight into this concept which can hopefully answer many aspects of education which are otherwise left unanswered, thereby helping in formulating better educational reforms."

Using semi-structured interviews with six school principals, this study found that most principals experience great difficulty in balancing their administrative responsibilities with their instructional responsibilities. However, the majority of the principals demonstrated innovative means of resolving challenges that blocked them from being leaders as learners. They remain mired between the old and new paradigms of instructional leadership, yet understand the impact instructional leadership can have even in incremental steps for creating learning communities and fostering the learning of their teachers, themselves and their students. The study shows that the traditional role of principals as managers has been expanded to instructional leaders. The manifestation of IL varied amongst the principals, continuing to evolve towards becoming shared instructional leadership and leader as learner. In order to promote their core responsibility of promoting effective teaching and learning, the principals needed to concentrate on being strategic about employing shared instructional leadership. This research has shown that the very essence of instructional leadership is to transform the school as an organisation into an environment where teachers and learners may reach their full potential."

Results indicated that teachers perceived their principals and immediate supervisors as exercising empowering behaviours in their daily practices, but they also perceived their principal and immediate supervisor differing in magnitude in some specific dimensions of empowering behaviours such as delegation of authority, providing individualised concern and support, articulating a vision and fostering collaborative relationships. Results also indicated that teachers' perceptions of principal's and immediate supervisor's empowering behaviours were positively associated with teachers' psychological empowerment, and that they added unique variance to each other in predicting teachers' psychological empowerment. This study suggests the importance of considering teachers' perceptions of principal's and immediate supervisor's empowering behaviours as two distinct constructs in empirical research so that their unique predictive power could be more aptly captured. From a practical standpoint, it suggests the importance for school leadership developers to enhance school leaders' awareness and capacity in exercising empowering behaviours towards their teachers in their daily practice.

We argue that educators can and should teach students that leader character is pivotal to leadership excellence and that they should actively develop students' leader character. The foundational learning theories of Piaget and Kolb provide a useful framework to help achieve the development of leader character. We propose that leader character development arises from using accommodation learning strategies of crucible experiences, paired with assimilation learning methods of critical reflection, and further developed through equilibrium learning strategies where students can incorporate new information and work toward their personal character growth. While numerous teaching approaches can be used, we describe an experiential course, codesigned with members of the Canadian Forces, using these learning strategies to foster leader character development."

The authors examine whether the new model, Teacher Peer Excellence Group (TPEG), fosters the desired key features of productive communities of practice where teachers can jointly construct, transform, preserve, and continuously deepen the meaning of effective teaching. The authors also explore the extent to which existing school conditions - principal instructional leadership, trust, teacher efficacy, and teachers' sense of school-wide professional community - enable or moderate the desired outcomes. Design/methodology/approach - Data for this paper are drawn from a series of surveys administered to teachers from 24 pilot schools in six school districts over two school years. Descriptive and multilevel modeling analyses are conducted. Findings - The findings provide encouraging evidence that, given sufficient support and guidance, teachers report higher levels of engagement in deprivatized practice and instructional collaboration. These findings also hold after controlling for key enabling conditions and school characteristics. Social implications - The TPEG approach challenges school leaders to take on the responsibilities of helping teachers make their practice public, sharable, and better - three critical objectives in the shift to develop the profession of teaching. Originality/value - The indication of TPEG model's positive impact on strengthening the features of communities of practice in selected public schools provides the impetus for further efforts in understanding the transformational changes needed and challenges ahead at the classroom, school, and district levels."

Applying an inclusive social-cognitive perspective, the study integrated the personal, organizational, and leadership domains to explain teachers' task performance, discretionary performance, and career aspirations. The three domains, represented by the independent variables of self-efficacy, collective efficacy, perceived organizational support, and principal leadership styles, predicted teachers' work performance and career aspirations. Participants included 897 public school teachers in a southern state in the United States. The data gathering instrument incorporated several previously validated scales on study constructs. The analyses indicated that teacher self-efficacy, collective efficacy, POS, and principal transformational leadership all significantly predicted the teachers' task performance, discretionary performance, and career aspirations. Study findings suggest directions for future research on factors influencing teachers' work performance and career aspirations."

For this reason, the research has three objectives: i) to describe the activities carried out by school principals; ii) to identify who accompanies the principals in the different activities; iii) to analyze the relationship between the management activities and the school's performance. We have opted for a quantitative study in which the daily practices of 42 principals of schools with good school performance and 42 principals of schools with low school performance are analyzed, according to the results of the National Tests. A Daily Record was used to identify the frequency of execution of activities. On the other hand, a scale was used to measure the school climate. The results indicate that the principals of the different groups formed, distributed the management time in the 10 directive activities identified, giving as a result that the activities to which the principals invested more time were: 1) Non-schools; 2) Relations with students; 3) Instructional Leadership and Goal Planning. The activities that received the least amount of time were: 1) Professional growth; 2) Finance; 3) Infrastructure. In relation to the types of accompaniment that the school principals had, in the group of schools classified by their performance and by the school climate, no differences were obtained. The principals carried out this activity with the following types of accompaniment First, alone (without accompaniment); second, accompanied by lead teachers, facilitators, and teachers. Thirdly, with vendors and contractors. Finally, there was no strong correlation between the activities carried out by the director and school performance."

However, unlike self-efficacy beliefs, collective teacher efficacy has been studied much less. Hence, this systematic literature mapping seeks to deepen the development and study of the collective efficacy beliefs of teachers in the academic field, with the objective of understanding and synthesizing the information of various investigations regarding the subject in question. Through the methodology of systematic mapping, a total of 60 potential studies published between 2000 and 2019 and indexed in the Scopus and Web of Science databases were found. After the application of the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 35 studies were included in the present investigation. The results show the geographical distribution of the studies, the most frequently cited articles, the variables related to collective teacher efficacy, the instruments used to evaluate these beliefs, and the educational levels in which they have been studied. There is a clear interest in the study regarding the impact of collective teacher efficacy on student learning and performance. However, there is a lack of research on this subject in Spanish-speaking countries, as well as research focused on the promotion and development of collective teacher efficacy. This study concludes with a proposal for future lines of research."

It directly or indirectly influences almost all factors that affect school transformation. It influences students' academic, social, emotional, cultural, and moral wellbeing as well as the performance, commitment, citizenship behavior, innovativeness, and instructional practices of the teachers. Effective leadership is always multidimensional and complex. Leaders in successfully transformed schools demonstrate multiple and distinct leadership behaviors in order to influence different aspects of school life. They encompass the ability to be task-oriented, change-oriented, relation-oriented, and ethical-oriented leaders. The purpose of this paper is twofold. First, it intends to portray how the four dimensions of leadership behavior collectively give a better and comprehensive elucidation for understanding school leadership. Second, it aims to justify how these four dimensions of leadership behavior can be integrated together to facilitate school transformation process. This paper analytically reviews research and writings on school leadership behavior and proposes a conceptual model applicable and appropriate to explain leadership in the context of school transformation. The proposed model extends the tri-dimensional leadership behavior theory by incorporating ethical-oriented leadership behavior in it. In addition, the conceptual model is supported through review of literature for its applicability in schools. From the review, it is found that the current literature on leadership behavior is quite baffling. Different behavior dimensions explained by different researchers are sometimes overlapping and contrasting to each other on the same leadership concepts, actions, or outcomes. Moreover, the current literature on leadership behavior in school context is mainly related to transformational, transactional, and instructional leadership behaviors. Despite that, some researchers have criticized and found theoretical and empirical weaknesses in those leadership behaviors due to the intervening effects of factors such as culture, personality, organization structure, and government policy. Conversely, at the general theoretical level, researchers have categorized many leadership behaviors into certain orientations such as task-oriented, relation-oriented, change-oriented behaviors, and ethical-oriented leadership behaviors. These behavior dimensions are not just a group of distinct behaviors, but they also give a better platform to compare and contrast studies by different researchers. The behavior constructs included in them are clear and distinct. These leadership orientations cover almost all behaviors proposed in instructional, transformational, ethical, moral, distributed, and transactional leadership models."

While effective schools research has established that strong principal leadership affects school academic achievement at least indirectly, this relationship is more complex than originally thought. Personnel decisions about principal effectiveness made by educational policymakers or lay-controlled school site councils should be made only after careful consideration of research on the relationship between principal instructional leadership and school outcomes. This article presents data from a study to determine whether principal instructional leadership is predictive of school outcomes and discusses the implications of the research for developing school improvement strategies."

Yet, until relatively recently, limited attention has been given to the ""methodology"" of conducting reviews of research. This observation also applies in educational leadership and management where reviews of research have charted intellectual progress since the field's inception in the 1950s and 1960s. This paper was framed as a ""methodological review of reviews of research"" in educational leadership and management. Method: The author analyzed 38 reviews of research in educational leadership published in nine international refereed journals over the past 52 years. The author applies a conceptual framework and analytical rubric for conducting systematic reviews of research in analyzing this sample of research reviews. Data analysis focuses on describing methodological characteristics, illuminating patterns of strength and weakness in review methods, and identifying a set of exemplary reviews. Findings: Despite publication of a number of ""exemplary reviews,"" there remains considerable room for improvement in the methodology of conducting systematic reviews of research in educational leadership and management. The study identified a tendency for research reviews in this field to omit key information concerning the rationale and nature of the studies included in the reviews, methods of data collection, extraction, evaluation and analysis, and how these choices impacted interpretation of the findings. Implications: This comprehensive set of 38 published review articles tracks the historical development of the field and, by itself, represents a rich harvest from the study. Within this historical corpus of reviews, the study identified a subset of ""exemplary reviews"" that can serve as useful models for future scholarship. Finally, by identifying patterns of methodological strength and weakness among the reviews as a group, the report offers empirically grounded recommendations for strengthening future reviews of research in educational leadership and management."

Approach and Methods: This article is both conceptual and empirical. The delineation of transformative leadership theory is conceptual and draws on its historical and more recent theoretical roots. To investigate it empirically, the author identified two principals from a larger study and, using a backward mapping approach, attempted to determine, using Evers and Wu's ( 2006) abductive reasoning, whether transformative leadership might include ""inference to the best explanation"" ( p. 518) for their practices. Participants, Data Collection, and Analysis: Using a set of predetermined criteria, the author selected two principals from a wider study of educators' pedagogical conceptions of social justice. The two were studied, using multiple interviews, confirmatory interviews with others, and observations in situ, to identify practices that might conform to categories of transformative leadership theory. Findings and Implications: Transformative leadership begins with questions of justice and democracy, critiques inequitable practices, and addresses both individual and public good. The author traced the practices of these principals to determine whether they were consistent with these and other elements of transformative leadership. She then considered alternate explanations and inferred from the data the best fit for transformative leadership, thus supporting its relevance for leadership for equity, deep democracy, and social justice."

The review sought to document the size, growth trajectory, and geographic distribution of EA research, identify high impact scholars and documents, and illuminate the ""intellectual structure"" of the field. Although science mapping has been applied widely in science, medicine, and social sciences, it is still new in the field of education. The authors identified 22,361 peer-reviewed articles published in 22 Scopus-indexed EA journals between 1960 and 2018. The authors used VOSviewer, Excel, and Tableau software to analyze the data set. The review found that the EA knowledge base has grown dramatically since 1960 with an accelerating rate growth and increasing gender and geographic diversity during the past two decades. Using co-citation analysis, the review identified canonical documents, defined as highly influential documents whose impact has been sustained for a period of several decades. The review also identified four key Schools of Thought that have emerged over time focusing on Leadership for Learning, Leadership and Cultural Change, School Effectiveness and School Improvement, and Leading Teachers. More broadly, our findings highlighted a paradigm shift from ""school administration"" to ""school leadership"" over the course of the six decades. Another significant finding identified ""leadership for student learning and development"" as the ""cognitive anchor"" of the intellectual structure of the EA knowledge base. The authors conclude that science mapping offers a new and useful means of unpacking the historical development of fields of study."
