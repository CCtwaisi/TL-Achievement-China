AB  - Purpose: The central purpose of this study is to investigate the relative effects of leadership styles, i.e. transactional leadership and transformational leadership, and achievement motivation on the entrepreneurial potential of MBA and engineering students. This study also examines whether the MBA and engineering students differ in terms of their entrepreneurial potential. Design/methodology/approach: This study has used a cross-sectional research design along with a quasi-experimental research method to investigate the study's objectives on a sample consisting of 952 engineering and business students. The study has also used the PLS-SEM approach to carry out the data analysis, and to evaluate the group differences among MBA and engineering students concerning the relationships investigated, i.e. leadership motivation-entrepreneurial potential, and achievement motivation-entrepreneurial potential. Findings: This research has primarily made four findings. First, the study has found that there are statistically significant differences between students pursuing a business education, and those students who are seeking management education about their entrepreneurial potential. Second, this study demonstrates that leadership and achievement motivation are strongly associated with entrepreneurial potential. Third, this research shows that the achievement motivation-entrepreneurial potential is more substantial among engineering students than among business students. However, the leadership-entrepreneurial potential relationship is more influential among MBA students than among engineering students. Lastly, the effect size of leadership is small in comparison with the effect size of achievement motivation, which is substantially healthy. Originality/value: This research has attempted to address the riddle of a leadership attribution error in the context of entrepreneurship. Accordingly, this study has demonstrated that the idea of leadership attribution error has empirical evidence in the context of entrepreneurship also. Further, this study has tried to address the “behavior-motive preeminence” dichotomy. The results of this research show that internal motivation is more reliable than external leadership behavior in cultivating the entrepreneurial potential of students. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - This study explores the unique potential of gifted sixth graders in Abu Dhabi, focusing on enhancing their verbal-linguistic intelligence and leadership skills through targeted educational interventions. Recognizing the critical need for specialized programs to support gifted students, this research employs a quasi-experimental design to evaluate the effectiveness of the Integrated Curriculum Model (ICM). Participants included sixth-grade students from two groups: an experimental group receiving the ICM intervention and a control group following the standard curriculum. We collected data using structured questionnaires and analyzed the results using mean, standard deviation, and t-tests to determine statistically significant differences between the groups. Findings revealed that the experimental group showed significantly higher improvements in both verbal-linguistic intelligence and leadership skills compared to the control group, with a significance level of.05. These results underscore the importance of tailored educational strategies in unlocking the full potential of gifted students. The study’s theoretical implications highlight the applicability of Gardner’s Theory of Multiple Intelligences and Burns’ Transformational Leadership Theory in educational settings. Practically, the findings provide valuable insights for educators, policymakers, and parents on the benefits of specialized programs for gifted students, suggesting that such interventions can also positively impact typically developing children. Future research should continue to explore and refine these educational strategies to further support the development of gifted students. © 2025 Common Ground Research Networks. All rights reserved.

AB  - Educational institutions across the nation are being unsuccessful at meeting academic goals set by the states and preparing students to be college and career ready. Many schools around the globe are suffering from a shortage of experienced and competent school leaders that can bring about positive change and increase student achievement. Thus, the objective of this study was to determine the correlation between leadership practices, school culture, and student achievement in an effort to build the capacity of principal leaders. A correlational design was used to determine the relationship between principal leadership practices, culture, and achievement in elementary, middle, and high schools. A total of 216 teachers in 31 schools completed the Leadership Practices Inventory and School Culture Survey. A significant correlation was found between (a) leadership practices and school culture and (b) school culture and student achievement. No relationship was established between leadership practices and school culture. The results implied that school leaders who use transformational leadership practices indirectly impact student achievement through creating a positive school culture. It is recommended that principal preparation programs revamp leadership curriculum to develop leaders who can create positive school cultures and manage reform efforts. © The Turkish Online Journal of Educational Technology.

AB  - Learning occurs at all levels in school and leadership for learning is an integral part of the school and that for learning to happen, there must be trust, autonomy and high level of teacher professionalism with a strong professional learning community. This chapter synthesizes information from various studies of principal instructional leadership since its inception in the 1980s, its subjection to the various changes that happen in schools during the accountability era and school-based management period, as well as the rising and waning of various theories, to show how it is influenced leading to its evolution into 'leadership for learning' which is also known as 'leading learning'. The original model of instructional leadership is initially described and how the subsequent transformational leadership, distributed leadership, and teacher leadership are incorporated into the original instructional leadership theory to produce an integrated leadership for learning were also elaborated. This chapter re-visits the belief and importance placed on school leadership in addition to its crucial role in students' academic achievement and school improvement. Based on reviews of earlier leadership theories, more insights into leadership across different contexts and professional activities can illustrate some of the benefits of such an approach. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2023.

AB  - This article focuses on challenges principals and lead teachers meet in diverse schools in Iceland. The study was conducted in nine schools at three school levels that have been successful in implementing social justice and in creating inclusive learning spaces. The framework of path-goal theory and transactional and transformational leadership guided the study. All the principals and lead teachers had a vision of pupil well-being and achievement. The findings show that all the principals and lead teachers were primarily participative in their leadership style. However, the leaders who were identified as being most proactive appeared to be more directive in style. © Universitetsforlaget.

AB  - 1. Background Systematic reviews may inform public policies and contribute to the building of a knowledge base. However, reviews of school leadership research are relatively rare in Taiwan. This study conducted a bibliometric review to analyze journal papers by Taiwanese scholars in the Scopus database published in the previous 20 years. The focus was to examine the connection between Taiwanese and global research on school leadership. 2. Research questions On the basis of the research background, four research questions were proposed: (1) What is the volume and growth trajectory of Taiwanese school leadership research?(2) What is the international visibility of Taiwanese school leadership research as revealed through citation analysis? (3) What are the main topics covered by Taiwanese school leadership research and how do they correspond to the global trend? (4) What is the intellectual structure of Taiwanese school leadership research and how do it connect with the global literature? 3. Theoretical framework (1) Intellectual development of school leadership research The theory movement in the 1950s and 1960s highlighted the development of educational administration research. Griffiths (1959) categorized these theories into four groups: social system and role theory, leadership theory, decision theory, and organizational theory. In the 1970s,contingency theory, which emphasizes the influence of context on leadership, was proposed. With the growing interest in school effectiveness and school reform, the organizational perspective was applied to investigate school leadership. Instructional leadership was also emphasized from then on. In the 1990s, other leadership approaches such as transformational leadership, moral leadership, and distributed leadership became popular in school leadership research. With the power paradigm shifting from a heroic view of leaders to a more dispersed view of power, distributed leadership and teacher leadership were also highly recognized. In response to the international context, leadership for learning, which includes elements of instructional leadership, transformational leadership, and shared leadership, has gained global attention in the new millennium. (2) Retrospective view of school leadership research Systematic reviews did not appear in the field of educational administration until the 1980s. EPPI-Centre (2012) indicated the four key features of systematic reviews. First, a high quality systematic review is explicit and is conducted using transparent methods. Second, it follows a standard set of stages. Third, the review is accountable, replicable, and updateable. Fourth, users should be involved to ensure reports are relevant and useful. The elements of reviews include the central topics of interest, guiding questions, and goals; a conceptual perspective for guiding there view’s selection, evaluation, and interpretation of the studies; sources and types of data; data evaluation and analysis; and the major results of the review (Hallinger, 2014). However, according to Hallinger’s study in 2014, only eight reviews met these criteria. Of the eight studies, some used critical synthesis, some adopted meta-analysis, and some employed both. In recent years, network analysis, data mining, and bibliometric analysis are increasingly being applied in systematic reviews. In addition to a greater diversity in methods, the regions under review have expanded from the United States and United Kingdom to many other regions. This development can be attributed to Hallinger’s effort to initiate international collaboration to build the knowledge base of educational leadership in Asia. Because of the growing interest in the academic development in non-Western countries, he promoted the use of systematic reviews to examine studies in Asia, Africa, Saudi Arabia, and Central and South America, which resulted in more than 30 systematic reviews on educational leadership and management. A wide range of research topics is a prominent feature of educational leadership and management research. Five topics that have gained frequent attention are social justice, female leadership, school leadership preparation and development, trust, and instruction and instructional leadership. The following are the topics of frontier research in this field: principal, school leadership, and student achievement; distributed leadership, instructional leadership, teacher learning, accountability, school improvement, school reform, and leadership development; and race, justice, and urban education. In Taiwan, research reviews on educational leadership are scant. According to Lin’s (2000) review, only a few studies have focused on the impact of principals on students. Pan’s (2010) review indicated that of all the educational leadership studies in government-funded projects and journals,70% of the topics were related to principals’ leadership styles and behaviors. The distribution of the research topics was not sufficiently diversified to reflect global academic development. 4. Research method This study used bibliometric analysis on the Scopus database to analyze Taiwanese school leadership research. The review process was based on the steps of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) developed by Moher et al. (2009). After the process of screening, identification, eligibility determination, and inclusion, 95 papers were included for analysis. Descriptive analysis, citation analysis, co-occurrence analysis of keywords, and co-citation analysis were conducted to address the research questions. 5. Research findings The study had the following three key findings: (1) Concerning the volume of publication in journals, the first English paper on Taiwanese school leadership research did not appear until 2001.Although the promotion of the world university rankings and the launch of the Top University Project have changed the trend of solely using Chinese for academic writing, the number of English studies on school leadership remains limited. Moreover, only 14.7% of papers are published in the core journals of education leadership and management. (2) A citation analysis revealed that the international visibility of Taiwanese school leadership research is low. The average number of papers of the 10 most cited Taiwanese scholars is 3.5, and they have been cited an average of 45.2times. The number of citations of Taiwanese scholars is 3.33 times less than that of African educational leadership research and 11.78 times less than that of research on three emerging regions. (3) The research topics selected by Taiwanese scholars may highlight international academic development; however, some underdeveloped topics remain such as social justice leadership, organizational theory, institutional theory, and social capital. The current co-citation analysis revealed the four schools of thought of Taiwanese school leadership, namely leadership for learning, distributed forms of leadership, leadership behavior and its impact, and social network. 6. Contributions Systematic reviews on school leadership are scarce in Taiwan. The present study conducted a 206 bibliometric analysis to examine the development and features of Taiwanese school leadership literature which is innovative in the research method. The connection between Taiwanese studies on school leadership research and global scholarship has seldom been addressed in relevant research. The current analysis presents the development of Taiwanese school leadership and its connection with global trends, providing critical insights and directions for future research on school leadership in Taiwan. 7. Implications The present findings indicate the future direction of Taiwanese academic development in the field of educational administration. First, publishing more research in English can help increase the international impact of Taiwanese scholars. Greater exposure in English publications can highlight the fruitful outcome of Taiwanese school leadership research internationally. Building the academic connections between Taiwan and other countries will also be beneficial. Second, the current study identified a gap between Taiwanese school leadership research and the global trend. Including more diversified topics may help broaden the scope of research. Some topics recommended for future study include social justice leadership, organizational theory, institutional theory, social capital theory, social justice theory, and critical racialism. Third, conducting periodic replication studies using bibliometric analysis may help track the development of Taiwanese school leadership research. In particular, this method allows for a comparison of the distinguishing features of research among different periods. Fourth, a bibliometric analysis on Taiwanese school leadership research published in Chinese would be of considerable value. Taiwan has several literature databases that collect domestic research. However, the data structure provides insufficient information for an effective bibliometric analysis. To maximize the usefulness of these databases, their data structure design merits special consideration. © 2021, National Taiwan Normal University. All rights reserved.

AB  - For effective technology leadership and for a comprehensive and appropriate use of technology in educational institutions, the standards essential for the heads of the institutions are: leadership and vision; learning and teaching; productivity and professional practice; support, management, and operations; assessment and evaluation; understanding of social, legal, and ethical issues related to technology; and interpersonal and communication skills. Information and Communication Technology (ICT) leadership supports effective instructional practices through a combination of interpersonal skills, knowledge of a variety of current technology applications, and the vision to anticipate future technology-based solutions for education. The potential benefits of good ICT leadership can include improved academic achievement by students, improved student attendance and reduced attrition, better vocational preparation of students, more efficient administrative operations, and reduced teacher/staff burnout and turnover. The main objectives of this study are to investigate principals’ ICT leadership practices in their respective colleges and the methods and strategies principals use to lead technology integration into the educational environment. Qualitative as well as quantitative data were collected by means of semi-structured interviews and questionnaires that were administered to teachers and principals of professional colleges. This study reveals that technology integration as an instructional strategy needs to be learned in the wider context of changing pedagogy and paradigms of thought about technology use in education. Principals who effectively lead ICT integration within their colleges classically perform well in leadership and management, vision and goal setting, student learning, teaching, professional development and training, operations and infrastructure support, and assessment and evaluation. © Springer India 2014.

AB  - This study examined the connection between transformational leadership by instructors and student engagement in Chinese higher vocational education, specifically examining the mediating function of student self-efficacy. Drawing on Bandura’s social cognitive theory, a quantitative cross-sectional design was employed to collect data from 1,034 students at five different Chinese Higher Vocational Colleges. These findings indicate that transformational leadership positively affects student engagement and self-efficacy. Their sense of self-efficacy moderated the relationship between leadership and student involvement. This study adopted structural equation modeling, which confirms the proposed relationships’ robustness. However, some limitations, such as the cultural context and limited representativeness, should be considered for future studies. Policymakers and practitioners in education can use these findings to inform efforts to enhance vocational education instruction and student achievements. Implications for practice include suggestions for bettering programs that support teacher leadership and for including self-efficacy tests in educational policies to increase student involvement. These findings have implications for policymakers and educational practitioners, particularly in designing teacher leadership training programs to improve student learning performance. © 2024, University of Malaya.

AB  - Purpose: Failure to identify any significant relationships between principal leadership and student achievement has proved concerns about the assumed value and legitimacy of principal leadership. The purpose of this paper is to contribute to the current literature by empirically testing the relationships between the principal leadership and the teacher self-efficacy, a construct which has a proven impact on student achievement. The role of collective efficacy on the relationship between transformational leadership of principals and self-efficacy of teachers was a special focus for the study. Design/methodology/approach: A causal comparative research design was employed to study the direct, indirect, and mediating relationships among principal leadership, teacher self-efficacy, and collective efficacy in schools. The participants included a cluster-random sample of 813 primary school teachers. Data gathering instruments composed of a combination of the Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire, the Collective Teacher Efficacy Scale and the Teacher's Sense of Efficacy Scale. A structural equation modelling with path analysis was employed to test the research models and hypotheses. Findings: Findings of the study demonstrated that collective efficacy and transformation leadership jointly shape teachers' self-efficacy. There was a significant relationship between principals' transformational leadership and teachers' self-efficacy beliefs. This relationship was mediated and magnified by collective efficacy in schools. Research limitations/implications: The study has the common limitations of the self-reported perceptions of participants. Originality/value: The study enlightened the little-known causal relationship mechanisms through which transformational leadership practices of principals and collective efficacy of schools affect the self-efficacy beliefs of teachers. The findings are in line with the socio-cognitive theory which assumes the presence of reciprocal relationships among leadership, organization, and person domains in shaping organizational behaviors of teachers. The study also parallels with the emerging literature about the mediating effects of collective efficacy on the relationship between principal transformational leadership and teacher self-efficacy. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine the relative impact of different types of leadership on students’ academic and nonacademic outcomes. The methodology involved an analysis of findings from 27 published studies of the relationship between leadership and student outcomes. The first meta-analysis, including 22 of the 7 studies, involved a comparison of the effects of transformational and instructional leadership on student outcomes. The second meta-analysis involved a comparison of the effects of five inductively derived sets of leadership practices on student outcomes. Twelve of the studies contributed to this second analysis. The first meta-analysis indicated that the average effect of instructional leadership on student outcomes was three to four times that of transformational leadership. Inspection of the survey items used to measure school leadership revealed five sets of leadership practices or dimensions: establishing goals and expectations; resourcing strategically; planning, coordinating, and evaluating teaching and the curriculum; promoting and participating in teacher learning and development, and ensuring an orderly and supportive environment. The second meta-analysis revealed strong average effects for the leadership dimension involving promoting and participating in teacher learning and development and moderate effects for the dimensions concerned with goal setting and planning, coordinating, and evaluating teaching and the curriculum. The comparisons between transformational and instructional leadership and between the five leadership dimensions suggested that the more leaders focus their relationships, their work, and their learning on the core business of teaching and learning, the greater their influence on student outcomes. The article concludes with a discussion of the need for leadership research and practice to be more closely linked to the evidence on effective teaching and effective teacher learning. Such alignment could increase the impact of school leadership on student outcomes even further. © 2014 Universidad Autonoma de Madrid. All rights reserved.

AB  - Purpose: Effective styles of principal leadership can help address multiple issues in struggling schools, such as low student achievement and high rates of teacher attrition. Although the literature has nominated certain "idealized" leadership styles as being more or less effective, such as transformational, instructional, and shared instructional leadership, we have little evidence about how principals may or may not choose to practice these styles across U.S. schools. Research Design: Latent class analysis was used to identify different types of principals across the United States. We analyzed the 1999-2000 Schools and Staffing Survey as it presents a unique opportunity to study the different types of U.S. principals since it contains leadership measures not found in other national surveys. A final sample of 7,650 public schools and principals was included in the analysis. Findings: Instead of idealized leadership styles signifying variations in practice, the differences between types of principals were defined by the degree of principal and teacher leadership. Further, the school and principal context, such as school size, urbanicity, accountability performance, and principal background, predicted the three significantly different principal types: controlling, frequent principal leadership; balkanizing, high degree of leadership shared with teachers; or integrating, frequent principal leadership as well as a high degree of leadership shared with teachers. Conclusions: These types suggest that principals simultaneously practice leadership behaviors associated with multiple leadership styles in accordance with their background and school context. These findings provide support for the use of more complex models to assess school leader effectiveness. © The University Council for Educational Administration 2013.

AB  - It is clear from the literature that there is no consensus on the most effective type of leadership behavior which promotes one of the main objectives of education, namely student achievement. This current study was initiated due to the prevalence of low student achievement as well as the observed controversies regarding effective types of leadership behaviors in secondary schools in the Gedeo Zone of Ethiopia. The aim of the study was to examine the effect of secondary school principals’ leadership behaviors on student outcomes in the zone and consequently to identify effective types of leadership constructs that could enhance learners’ success. An explanatory sequential mixed-design approach was used with a sample of six schools which were chosen by using a maximum variation strategy. Out of these six sampled schools, eighteen (18) participants, comprising of six (6) principals, four (4) district supervisors, two (2) zone education experts and six (6) PTSA chairmen were chosen for the qualitative phase. These participants were selected purposively as they have a better understanding, by virtue of their position regarding the effect of principals’ leadership behavior on student achievement. A close-ended questionnaire was used to collect quantitative data, while interviews and document analysis were used as research instruments in the qualitative phase. The findings of this study indicate that effective practicing of a combination of instructional and transformational leadership behaviors, in integrative ways, enhances student outcomes. ©Authors.

AB  - Introduction: This study examined the relationship between transformational leadership (TFL) behaviors of coaches and positive youth development (PYD) outcomes in Japanese youth sports settings. Research has shown associations between TFL and various athlete outcomes in Western sports contexts. However, limited attention has been paid to how cultural factors shape these relationships in East Asian settings, particularly within Japanese sports culture that emphasizes hierarchical relationships and collectivist values. Methods: The study included 112 first-year undergraduate students from a sports science program at a Japanese university. Athletes' perceptions of their coaches' TFL behaviors and PYD outcomes were assessed using the Differentiated Transformational Leadership Inventory for Youth Sport (DTLI-YS) and the Youth Experience Survey for Sport (YES-S). Results: Correlation analyses revealed a particularly strong association between high performance expectations and initiative (r =.53, p <.01), notable when compared to American research where correlations between PYD outcomes and TFL dimensions were typically weaker (r =.11 –.43). Regression analyses further showed that high performance expectations were significantly associated with both goal setting (β =.29, p <.05) and initiative (β =.39, p <.01). Analysis by competition level revealed significant differences in initiative (F = 4.07, p <.01, η² =.10) and total YES-S scores (F = 2.75, p <.05, η² =.07). Discussion: These findings contribute to understanding how cultural context shapes the relationship between coaching leadership and youth development in sports. While the prominence of high performance expectations reflects Japanese sports culture's emphasis on discipline and collective achievement, results suggest the importance of incorporating a more balanced leadership approach that includes elements beyond high performance expectations to foster comprehensive athlete development. 2025 Nakayama and Izawa.

AB  - In spheres beyond the student achievement literature, the notion of excellence includes consideration not only of the individual behaviors that represent excellence in action, but also the conditions or environments that foster or provide opportunities for growth in this direction. Unless the conditions for excellence to occur are present, this quality may remain inert. Emerging from this chapter is the concept of “critical playing." Reaching beyond critical thinking, “critical playing” engages the learners’ physical, emotional, social, intellectual and spiritual selves. It is a qualitative state of excellence which can exist in both teachers and students, whereby individuals are deeply connected to themselves, the lesson content, and their interactions with others in a healthy school community. Authors have referred to this concept of “flow” to describe when students are performing at their potential (Csikzenmihalyi, 1980). Educational environments that nurture both “critical playing” and “flow” foster a rich environment to promote student achievement. This chapter suggests that there are individual and organizational factors which enhance the development of high performing students, by building a culture of achievement, thereby allowing these teachers to inspire critical playing, flow and excellence in their students. First, the notions of expertise and excellence in individual students are examined using Bereiter and Scardamalia’s (1993) research on expertise. Orlick’s (1992) Wheel of Excellence involves several key traits in the individual high performer which are indicators of excellence. These characteristics include “commitment, belief in oneself, full focus, distraction control, constructive evaluation, positive images and mental readiness” (p. 110). Orlick’s examination of high performers in many professional fields is comparable to the characteristics needed by students to excel. These characteristics needed to be successful are also reiterated by the Conference Board of Canada Employability Skills (2016) and the Davos World Conference (2015) on skills needed to excel for 2020. The second key element in this conceptual framework is an investigation of the organizational parameters which affect student excellence. Many authors have studied the primary factors which are considered to be indicators of a high-performing educational organization (Carter, 2002; Meehan, Wiersma, Cowley, Craig, Orletsky & Childers, 2002; Trimble, 2002; Cibulka & Nakayama, 2000). In this research, Cibulka and Nakayama’s (2000) work identifies some characteristics of high-performing schools, including a “collaborative culture, transformational leadership, reflective practice, an ethic of interpersonal caring, increasing standards of professional development, and accountability for high standards” (p. 23). A third critical element in this framework is the impact of health promoting schools on both student achievement and teacher performance. A great deal of research supports the idea that the characteristics of a healthy school are also key features of an institution which nurtures student and teacher excellence (Anderson, 2002; Laforet-Fleisser & Mitchell, 2002; Youngs, 1993; Anderson & Piran, 2001). Finally, the paper will address the integration of these themes as they are ubiquitously woven through the student-centred learning experience. Students are encouraged to strive for excellence if each of these three elements are present in the learning environment achievements. © 2017 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

AB  - This paper addresses a wicked problem faced by leaders wanting to be evidence informed in their choices of school improvement priorities and the most productive leadership practices to enact in pursuing those priorities. While local contexts will always be central to these choices, results of research ought to provide useful points of departure. But determining what relevant evidence recommends, local context aside, is far more difficult that the admonition to be ‘evidence informed’ seems to imply and the research community has offered few systematic solutions to the problem. This paper offers one possible solution, the calculation of ‘Power Indices’ using, for the purposes of illustration, evidence about the effects of a selected set of potential school improvement priorities (teachers’ emotions) on student learning, in combination with evidence about the effects on teacher emotions of a selected set of transformational leadership practices. Results argue for the value of a unique line of future research enabling school leaders to make choices about both school improvement priorities and how they might best pursue those priorities that systematically reflect the results of relevant evidence. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - It is believed that without high-performing leaders in an educational organization as well as committed academic staff, student academic achievement would be affected, the management will collapse and the overall quality of education will deteriorate. Hence, this research explores the relationship between transformational leadership styles of Heads of Departments and organizational commitment of academic staff in Polytechnic Kuching Sarawak. A total of 165 academic staff from eight major departments were involved in this quantitative research. The findings showed that the Heads of Departments practiced a high level of transformational leadership styles. Besides that, the level of organizational commitment among the academic staff was proven to be high. The findings also revealed that a significant relationship existed between transformational leadership style of Heads of Departments and organizational commitment of academic staff in Polytechnic Kuching Sarawak. This research contributes to the development of an organization by encouraging other polytechnics to practice transformational leadership style to ensure academic staff commitment leading to a more effective and sustainable organization. © 2018, University of Malaya.

AB  - Purpose: This article illustrates how successful leaders combine the too often dichotomized practices of transformational and instructional leadership in different ways across different phases of their schools’ development in order to progressively shape and “layer” the improvement culture in improving students’ outcomes. Research Methods: Empirical data were drawn from a 3-year mixed-methods national study (“Impact Study”) that investigated associations between the work of principals in effective and improving primary and secondary schools in England and student outcomes as defined (but not confined) by their national examination and assessment results over 3 years. The research began with a critical survey of the extant literature, followed by a national survey that explored principals’ and key staff’s perceptions of school improvement strategies and actions that they believed had helped foster better student attainment. This was complemented by multiperspective in-depth case studies of a subsample of 20 schools. Findings: The research provides new empirical evidence of how successful principals directly and indirectly achieve and sustain improvement over time through combining both transformational and instructional leadership strategies. The findings show that schools’ abilities to improve and sustain effectiveness over the long term are not primarily the result of the principals’ leadership style but of their understanding and diagnosis of the school’s needs and their application of clearly articulated, organizationally shared educational values through multiple combinations and accumulations of time and context-sensitive strategies that are “layered” and progressively embedded in the school’s work, culture, and achievements. Implications: Mixed-methods research designs are likely to provide finer grained, more nuanced evidence-based understandings of the leadership roles and behaviors of principals who achieve and sustain educational outcomes in schools than single lens quantitative analyses, meta-analyses, or purely qualitative approaches. The findings themselves provide support for more differentiated, context sensitive training and development for aspiring and serving principals. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.

AB  - Background/purpose: This study aims to investigate the influence of leadership (principal and teacher leadership) and school climate on student achievement as well as the moderating effect of some variables in this relationship. Materials/methods: With this purpose, a meta-analysis of data gathered from a total of 90 empirical studies including 83,337 participants was performed. The random effects model was utilized to measure the overall effect sizes. Results: The results showed that leadership and school climate had a moderate effect on academic achievement. In the USA context, organizational climate, principal leadership, and teacher leadership affected student achievement respectively. However, in the Turkish context, teacher leadership had a greater influence on student achievement the school climate, and principal leadership. The analysis also revealed that the influence of leadership on student achievement was attained through transformational, supportive, distributed, and instructional leadership practices respectively. Among the moderators tested, only the education level was determined to moderate the effect of school climate on student achievement. It was also concluded that an open organizational climate in primary schools had a greater effect on academic achievement. Conclusion: The current study evidenced that leadership and school climate are significant variables in improving student achievement. © The Author(s), 2025.

AB  - The focus of this chapter is to highlight two different transformational change initiatives in public schools that rely on student leadership to be effective. Both programs will explore effective ways to empower students as leaders, to make better social decisions, and to improve their attachment to school and community. One program involves a student-led technology club in a middle school. The goal of the club is to assist with the school's technology usage while also making a positive impact on participating students' achievement and attachment to school. The other program involves educating high school students on the risks of heroin and opioid addiction. Both programs seek to leverage student empowerment to induce long-term, positive behavior change in the students directly involved as well as those around them. © 2022, IGI Global.

AB  - The advantages of suburban life do not necessarily guarantee a secure future for many young people of color. A recent US study indicates that despite being raised in elite neighborhoods, Black males raised in affluent conditions are less likely than White males to maintain their wealth status into adulthood. While strong instruction, adult support, and inclusive cultures have been proven to mitigate a myriad of risk factors for historically marginalized groups of students, opportunity gaps continue to face young people of color, even in affluent suburban districts, where the appearance of a level playing field can lead educators to underestimate their role in building social capital in their students. High graduation rates notwithstanding, school leaders in suburban districts must be prepared to lead staff to understand the critical impact of disparities in preparation on the competitiveness of their students of color and firstgeneration students. They must seek to uncover critical differences in how opportunities are parceled out, address subtle barriers to access, resist the “opportunity hoarding” that works to maintain the status quo in many districts, and develop in staff the pedagogical and relational skills that engage students of color in the highest opportunities available to them. Though many school administrators may be White, middle class, and personally unfamiliar with some of the racial and socioeconomic challenges that face many suburban districts today, their effectiveness in eliminating achievement and opportunity gaps will hinge on their ability to prepare all students for competition on a playing field that remains anything but level. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.

AB  - Demand for postgraduate qualifications in medical education can be judged by the increase in providers worldwide over the last two decades. However, research into the impact of such courses on identity formation of healthcare professionals is limited. This study investigates the influence of such programmes on graduates’ educational identities, practices and career progression. Informed by constructivist grounded theory (CGT), semi-structured interviews were conducted with 27 graduates (2008–2012) from one postgraduate programme, who were at different stages in their careers worldwide. The audio data were transcribed and analysed using a CGT approach. Participants enrolled in award-bearing medical education courses for various intrinsic and extrinsic reasons. The findings from this study highlight their development as educators, and educational researchers, leaders and learners, as their self-efficacy in educational practices and engagement in scholarly activities increased. Graduates attributed career progression to the qualification, with many being promoted into senior positions. They also described substantial performance attainments in the workplace. The findings contribute to understanding the complexity and nuances of educational identity formation of healthcare professionals. A qualification in medical education encouraged transformational changes and epistemological development as an educator. Awareness of these findings will inform both those considering enrolment and those supporting them of potential benefits of these programmes. © 2018, The Author(s).

AB  - The Leadership for Learning (LfL) framework is often used to investigate the effect of leadership on student achievement (SA). This framework encompasses instructional leadership (IL), transformational leadership (TL), and distributed leadership (DL) qualities that are likely to influence teaching–learning processes at school. The existing literature indicates that LfL can influence both teacher performance and practices and students’ achievement significantly. The current study aims to investigate the mediating role of teacher performance in the relationship between LfL and student achievement using meta-analytical structural equation modeling (MASEM). Correlation values obtained from 60 studies (a total of 36,331 participants) investigating the relationship between these variables were used for the meta-analysis. The findings showed that all three types of leadership affected teacher performance directly, and teacher performance had a direct effect on student achievement. While the effect of IL on SA was mostly indirect, TL and DL were found to affect student achievement both directly and indirectly through teacher performance. Our findings suggest significant implications for not only researchers but also policy-makers and practitioners to improve school performance. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - Online learning is one of the learning designs considered more efficient in terms of time, as it can be done anywhere and anytime. This study investigates two factors that may influence mathematics achievement in the context of online learning: self-regulated learning and self-efficacy. The researcher aimed to explain the relationships between online learning and mathematics achievement, self-regulated learning and mathematics achievement, self-efficacy and mathematics achievement, self-regulated learning and online learning, self-efficacy and online learning, self-efficacy and online learning with mathematics achievement, and self-regulated learning and online learning with mathematics achievement. The validity of the research instrument was first tested through expert judgment. The sample consisted of grade VIII students from schools implementing the new curriculum in Indonesia. The data were analyzed using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). The results showed that mathematics achievement is directly influenced by online learning, self-regulated learning, and self-efficacy. Furthermore, when online learning acts as a moderating variable, mathematics achievement is also indirectly influenced by self-efficacy and self-regulated learning. © 2025, Duzce University, Faculty of Education.

AB  - “Although standards-based reform emerged in the United States and the United Kingdom, the idea has spread across the world, as an approach to systemic reform. It might appear that there is a world-wide “tsunami” of standards-based reform that will standardize and homogenize the educational system across the globe. This volume makes it very clear, however, that there is no one approach to standards-based reform and countries change – there is a danger in paying attention to its evolution and impact in only one context. That’s what makes this volume so valuable. Louis Volante has drawn together descriptions from a wide range of countries, all involved in large-scale reform and using standards and assessments as part of their process. What becomes very obvious is that the language may be the same but the words reflect different contexts and can represent very different ideals, values, and processes. I’m sure you will find this book as interesting and challenging as I have – a gem that pushes your thinking and does not allow readers to remain neutral.” (Lorna Earl) © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2012.

AB  - Principal leadership behaviors affect the improvement of school outcomes significantly, not only by providing psychological and professional support for teachers but also by facilitating a positive learning environment at school. This has cultivated both policy and research interest in understanding how principals' leadership behaviors can leverage student outcomes both directly and indirectly through teachers. In this quest, three leadership models have become prominent due to their close relation to classroom instruction and learning: instructional, transformational, and distributed leadership. The current study aims to reveal the relationships between these leadership behaviors of principals and student outcomes as well as assess the mediating effect of teacher self-efficacy on this relationship. Utilizing meta-analytic structural equation modelling (MASEM) methodology, the study analyzes data from prior studies to offer a more comprehensive and holistic analysis of the complex relationships between the variables. The analysis of data from 90 studies showed that all three leadership behaviors affected student outcomes both directly and indirectly through teacher self-efficacy. They also had a moderate direct influence on teacher self-efficacy, while teacher self-efficacy had a moderate effect on student outcomes. These results reiterate the significance of principals' leadership for learning to facilitate student outcomes and suggest that the integrated practice of leadership in accordance with contextual requirements could leverage the effectiveness and improvement of schools. © 2025 The Authors

AB  - This study explores the impact of transformational leadership by teachers on academic achievement among students in applied universities in Hebei Province, China. Furthermore, the study examines the roles of psychological capital, self-regulation, and conscientiousness in the relationship between psychological capital and academic achievement. A questionnaire survey method and convenience sampling were used to collect 719 formal questionnaires. The research results indicate that universities of applied sciences in Hebei Province, China, perceive that a teacher’s transformational leadership has a significant positive impact on students’ academic achievement. Moreover, perceiving a teacher’s transformational leadership has a significant positive impact on students’ psychological capital and self-regulation, both of which have a significant positive impact on academic achievement. Psychological capital and self-regulation mediate the relationship between teachers’ transformational leadership and students’ academic achievement. Furthermore, conscientiousness moderates the relationship between psychological capital and academic achievement. © 2024 Common Ground Research Networks. All rights reserved.

AB  - Effective leadership is essential in transforming schools into vibrant learning environments that foster teachers' professional growth and boost student achievement. Among various leadership styles, transformational leadership, with its emphasis on vision, support, and innovation, stands out due to its potential to maximize performance and foster school success. The objective of this research is to translate and culturally adapt the Global Transformational Leadership Scale (GTL) by Carless et al. (2000) into Turkish, with a focus on its application in educational institutions. The adaptation process followed a rigorous methodology to ensure the scale's semantic and conceptual equivalence in Turkish culture. This process involved translation, back-translation, and revisions based on expert feedback. The research was conducted with a sample of 322 teachers from a mid-sized city in eastern Türkiye, and data collection took place in three phases: linguistic equivalence testing with English teachers, parallel testing with the Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire and other relevant scales, and test-retest reliability analysis. CFA was performed to verify the scale's factor structure, and various validity and reliability measures were assessed, including convergent validity, nomological validity, and measurement invariance across gender, education level, and tenure. The results indicated that the adapted GTL scale is a reliable and valid instrument for measuring transformational leadership in Turkish educational institutions. © 2024, Dokuz Eylul University.

AB  - While sustainability simply means maintaining resources for future generations, it is hard to imagine the success and continuity of any plan of sustainability without the active inclusion of the leaders of the future. Furthermore, as enhancing the quality of living is one of the main programs fostered by Saudi 2030 vision, increasing societal awareness and involvement in adopting life style changes becomes of crucial importance. In alignment with Prince Sultan University strategic plan, the Environment students club took the initiative of a comprehensive campaign under the title of Go Green I & II (2017 & 19 respectively). The campaign aims at enhancing students' involvement to adopt green living and recycling concepts in daily life. It also aims at reducing waste and transforming the campus to an environment friendly domain. More importantly the campaign fosters students' leadership by enabling students to take the initiative and create, invent and implement the targeted changes which guarantee continuity and sustainability. The current study examines the experiment employed at the campaign and proposes pedagogical measures that maintain the achievements and augment students' involvement in the future. Adopting multidisciplinary dialogic methodology, this case study briefly demonstrates the pedagogical approaches selected in the campaigns such as implementation of zero paper courses, and designing contemporary and efficient recycling pins. Employing the theoretical concepts of collaborative learning and green design frameworks this paper aims at: 1) examining the Go Green Campaign and its alignment with PSU's strategic plan and the Saudi 2030 National Transformational Plan, 2) investigating the pedagogical approaches employed such as collaborative learning and their effectiveness in reaching assigned goals, 3) proposing future approaches to enhance students and societal involvement in implementing sustainability and green living procedures. © IEOM Society International.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to compare transformational and instructional leadership theories, examine the unique impact that school leaders have on student achievement, and determine which specific leadership practices are associated with increased student achievement. The sample for this study consisted of 590 teachers in 37 elementary schools in the Intermountain West of the United States. Teachers rated their principals' leadership style according to the Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire (Transformational Leadership) and the Principal Instructional Management Rating Scale (Instructional leadership). Student achievement was measured by a criterion referenced test. Hypotheses were tested using regression analysis. Results indicated that instructional leadership explained more of the variance in student achievement than did transformational leadership. Principals' leadership style tended to have a meaningful impact on student achievement beyond the impact of school context and principal demographics. Specific leadership functions associated with student achievement were also identified and reported. Conclusion, implications and limitations are also discussed. © The Author(s) 2013.

AB  - Dual language immersion (DLI) programs are gaining traction in California as a solution to serve English learners and prepare students for a globalized world. Successful implementation of DLI programs requires educational leaders, particularly principals, to embrace a shared, asset-oriented vision. This chapter explores the attributes of effective DLI principals and key considerations for leadership teams during the planning and implementation phases. Drawing on two qualitative studies, this chapter examines the distinct traits of principals in DLI programs, and the essential steps needed to ensure bilingualism for both English learners and native English speakers. Effective DLI principals demonstrate a commitment to multilingualism, advocate for students from diverse backgrounds, and exhibit the courage to lead transformational change. Successful program implementation depends on ongoing planning and active community engagement. The chapter concludes that strong leadership in DLI programs is critical for closing achievement gaps and ensuring equitable outcomes for all students. © 2025, IGI Global Scientific Publishing.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to delve into the characteristics, professional competencies, leadership attitudes, and behaviors of successful school principals (SSPs) in socioeconomically disadvantaged schools. Utilizing a systematic grounded theory method (SGTM), we conducted research in the provinces of Amasya, Çorum, Samsun, and Tokat in Türkiye. Purposeful and theoretical sampling methods were employed to recruit successful school principals, deputy principals, teachers, students, and parents from secondary schools affiliated with the Ministry of National Education (MoNE). The data draws on unstructured individual and focus group interviews, as well as documents and observations. All the data obtained were inductively analyzed through open, axis, and selective coding stages. Based on the codes, sub-categories, categories, themes, and dimensions from the analyses, we designed the Contextual Successful School Principalship Model (CSSPM), which falls into four dimensions as follows: individual, managerial, organizational, and instructional. SSPs in this study mostly tend to display paternalistic leadership attitudes and behaviors in terms of dedication and self-sacrifice, serving, intrinsic motivation, and influencing stakeholders. They exhibit almost all the attitudes and behaviors of servant leadership, act according to some national and moral values, and experience national attitudes such as patriotism and nationalism intensely. By giving importance to the academic socialization of students' mothers, successful school principals exhibit transformational and instructional leadership behaviors. They act strategically to directly involve mothers in enhancing student achievement, demonstrating their commitment to fostering an inclusive and supportive educational environment. © 2024, Ozgen Korkmaz.

AB  - This systematic literature review critically evaluates 14 empirical studies published over a 14 years span (2006–2019) to answer questions about the models and the effects of transformational school leadership on student academic achievement. The analysis of the related literature utilized vote counting and narrative synthesis to delineate the status quo of the current research field. It was found that the majority of these studies were conducted in Western and English- speaking countries and these studies utilizing different research methods and models reported mixed results. Recommendations for future research directions include use of an integrated leadership framework and complexity in the study of leadership in schools. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - With the nation’s public schools serving a more diverse student population than ever before, the role of the school leader is becoming increasingly complex. Research indicates principal preparation programs are inadequately preparing leaders to address the systemic inequities hindering non-White students’ achievement. Administrators in urban public schools face particularly well-documented equity challenges. Providing urban school leaders with the tools to navigate the pressures of their jobs while driving equitable student outcomes is a relevant policy consideration. This chapter presents emotional intelligence (EI) as an agent of transformational leadership and positions emotionally intelligent leadership as a meaningful urban education reform. In rooting our analysis in organizational and ecological systems theories, we aim to (1) nest EI literature within extant research addressing challenges uniquely affecting urban schooling contexts, (2) explore how EI can support urban leaders in addressing and mitigating school-based inequities, and (3) examine benefits of building school leaders’ EI capacity in relation to the most current federal education policies and urban demographic data. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.

AB  - Continuous reflective practices are a driving agent in allowing educational stakeholders to understand the consistent need for recurring change in P-12 learning.settings. In this chapter,.school leaders describe how they are supporting teachers and ancillary instructional staff with implementing transformative action-based programs. Four transformative leadership initiative case studies will be described. The authors bring various perspectives of supporting program implementation due to their roles in school districts as an elementary ELL teacher, a teacher coach and math teacher, and a district supervisor of Early Childhood education. The first case study will walk readers through how the infusion of a literacy program was conducted using transformational read-alouds to boost reading engagement and motivation amongst English language learners. Next, a teacher coach and math teacher will share how professional learning communities (PLCs) were utilized to promote collaboration amongst K-5 teachers throughout the implementation of a new core mathematics program. The third case study examines a doctoral student project that provided evidence based professional development on early science inquiry. Finally, a Supervisor of Early Childhood details how teachers were supported with the implementation of a three-tiered instructional intervention designed to aid preschool students with developing kindergarten readiness skills to close an identified transitionary achievement gap between preschool and kindergarten classrooms in the participating school district. © 2021, IGI Global.

AB  - As the most-studied form of leadership across disciplines in both Western and Chinese contexts, transformational school leadership has the potential to suit diverse national and cultural contexts. Given the growing evidence showing the positive effects of transformational leadership on various school outcomes as it relates to school environment, teacher and student achievement, we wanted to explore the factors that gave rise to transformational leadership. The purpose of this study was to identify and compare the antecedents fostering transformational leadership in the contexts of both the United States and China. This paper reviews and discusses the empirical studies of the last two decades, concentrating on the variables that are antecedent to transformational leadership mainly in the educational context, but also in public management, business and psychology. Results show that transformational leadership is related to three sets of antecedents, which include: (1) the leader’s qualities (e.g., self-efficacy, values, traits, emotional intelligence); (2) organizational features (e.g., organization fairness); and (3) the leader’s colleagues’ characteristics (e.g., follower’s initial developmental level). Some antecedents were common to both contexts, while other antecedents appeared to be national context specific. The implications of the findings for future research and leader preparation in different national contexts are discussed. © 2017 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to examine the role of teacher job satisfaction and school climate in mediating the relative effects of principals’ instructional and transformational leadership practices on student outcomes. Design/methodology/approach – Guided by strong evidence from theories on school leadership and work psychology, the authors hypothesized relations among dimensions of principals’ instructional and transformational leadership behaviors, teachers’ perception of the school climate (social and affective, and physical environment), their job satisfaction and student achievement. The benefits of the principal’s leadership behaviors for student achievement are primarily hypothesized as indirect, with either a weak or statistically non-significant direct positive effect on student outcomes. Path modeling was applied to validate a mediated-effects model using cross-sectional survey data (306 principals, 1,539 teachers) obtained from 306 secondary schools in the two Indian metropolitan cities of New Delhi and Kolkata. Findings – Principal leadership behaviors were not associated directly with either teacher job satisfaction or school-aggregated student achievement. Rather, the transformational leader behavior showed an indirect effect, through the social and affective component of the school climate, on teacher job satisfaction. The physical climate, however, appeared to play a dominating role in mediating the instructional leadership effects on teacher job satisfaction. Comparing the relative indirect effect sizes of the instructional and transformational leadership behaviors on student achievement, principals appear to favor the former approach. Originality/value – This study provides further empirical evidence that instructional leadership better captures the impact of school leadership on student outcomes, when compared to its transformational counterpart. By identifying the relative effects of different leadership practices, school leaders and educational practitioners can focus more on altering the distribution and frequency of those practices that work best for ameliorating student achievement levels. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - It is crucial to note that educational leadership is one of the most active drivers of various forms of change within institutions. This review tends to discuss various types of leadership styles, including democratic, autocratic, transformational, servant, and transactional, and how these different approaches influence the handling of change in schools. From the literature review, it is clear that various approaches toward leadership may give different results depending on the context and the specific condition of the challenge that faces educational leaders. While democratic, transformational, and servant leadership are likely to foster collaboration, inclusiveness, and creativity, autocratic and transactional forms of leadership ensure timely decision-making and maintenance of order in certain circumstances. The findings suggest that, for educational leaders to be successful, they need to implement flexible approaches to the needs of their institutions in creating settings that will support student achievement and innovation, as well as foster general school improvement. This review therefore concludes with implications for leadership practices in driving successful change initiatives in education. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2025.

AB  - Your start-up menu for super-charged culture change There's an invisible thread woven through your school that defines everything from dress codes to student success. It's your school culture, and reshaping it will yield highly visible improvements for teachers and students. Leslie Kaplan and William Owings guide you in improving leadership, teaching, learning, confidence, and trust throughout your school. Culture Re-Boot reframes school culture to include organizational learning, relational trust, accountability, program improvement, and teacher effectiveness while showing you how to: Be the transformational leader your school needs to reinvigorate your school culture; Establish a student-centered learning culture focused on student outcomes; Engage teachers in culture-focused leadership teams that support teacher and student learning; Get parents and community on-board to collaborate for student achievement; Connect professional development and school culture for maximum results Packed with hands-on culture re-boot activities to help school leaders and faculty revitalize their school's values and practices, this practical handbook for school improvement will energize your school's culture and build the capacity to help all students succeed. “Ever since Seymour Sarason wrote his seminal book on The Culture of Schools and the Problem of Change, we have known that ‘culture’ is at the heart of all organizational performance. But reformers keep forgetting this key fact. Kaplan and Owings’ book changes all that. Now in one place you can find everything you need to know to ‘re-boot’ you own school's culture.” —Michael Fullan, Author of Motion Leadership “As a principal focused on student achievement and school climate, I am excited to begin using these strategies and discussions to drive our conversations to a deeper and more meaningful level. The combination of school culture, professional learning community, and teacher/community leadership provides a compelling and unique exploration of real methods to sustain student achievement and school improvement.” —William Richard Hall, Jr., Principal R.

AB  - Aim: While integrated leadership has received significant scholarly attention in the past decade, most existing research in this vein has focused on its impact on student achievement and often dismissed how it might be related to instructional practices, which are at the center of many school reforms. In this research, we examined the relationship between integrated leadership and teacher professional learning and teacher practices in Turkey, where educational policy makers have recently introduced several school reform initiatives. More specifically, we aimed to examine the moderating function of transformational leadership in the relationship between instructional leadership and teacher practices, with an emphasis on the mediating role of teacher professional learning. Research Design: We conducted this study with a cross-sectional design and moderated mediation model. Data collected from 616 teachers working in a mix of primary and secondary schools in Turkey were analyzed using structural equation modeling and bootstrapping tests. Findings: We found evidence that transformational leadership acted as a moderator of the indirect effect of principal instructional leadership on teachers' instructional practices through teacher professional learning. Implications: This study adds to the accumulated body of knowledge on the effects of school leadership by concluding that the effect of instructional leadership on teacher learning and practice is contingent upon the extent to which principals enact transformational leadership. School principals who adopt a more comprehensive leadership approach that combines instructional leadership and transformational leadership practices can maximize their effects on student achievement through teacher learning, and better address the ever-growing demands of educational reforms. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - Unfortunately, the role of school leadership in fostering school improvement in non-Western countries, especially African countries, is relatively little discussed. The present study sheds light on the contextual role of instructional leadership (IL) and transformational leadership (TL) in promoting the Ethiopian School Improvement Program (SIP), which is intended to enhance student academic performance. Hence, this study aimed to extend the integrated leadership model by conceptualizing the moderating mediation effect of IL on student academic achievement in public primary schools. A cross-sectional study was performed by distributing a survey to 1280 public primary school teachers in Addis Ababa. Surprisingly, the study's findings affirmed that unlike previous studies, IL and TL significantly directly affect student academic performance, and TL plays a significant role as a moderator of the indirect effect of IL on student academic achievement. © 2023 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

AB  - While infusion of technology into schools has been one of the top priorities of the education reform agenda across the world, findings from many large-scale international assessments indicate that students’ use of information and communication technology (ICT) has mixed effects on their academic achievements. In this paper, we argue that these ambivalent findings were due to the oversight of the indirect effects of ICT use mediated by other ICT-related variables. We employed multilevel structural equation modelling to unfold the relationship between students’ ICT use and their academic achievements based on PISA 2015 data. The results indicated that students’ autonomy in ICT use and students’ interest in ICT use were found to have significant positive direct effects on students’ academic achievements at both within-school and between-school levels. These two variables played a significant role in mediating the indirect effects of ICT use outside school for schoolwork and ICT resources on students’ academic achievements. On the contrary, ICT resources and ICT use at school exerted either no direct effect or a negative direct effect on students’ academic achievements and students’ perceived autonomy related to ICT use, suggesting that mere provision and use of ICT resources in school did not necessarily guarantee success in student performance. At the school level, school’s transformational leadership and collaborative climate helped promote students’ autonomy in ICT use © 2022, Educational Technology and Society.All Rights Reserved.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this article is to detail the results of a large survey based research project which sough to examine the relationships among leadership, organizational learning and teacher and student outcomes. Design: A large survey based on questionnaires developed from non-school organizations was used to develop a model to test the nature and strength of the relationships between variables and to understand the interactive nature of leadership and organizational learning and their effects on student outcomes. Model testing employed a latent variables partial least squares path analysis procedure. Findings: The results of research have shown that leadership characteristics of a school are important factors in promoting systems and structures that enable the school to be effective and improve, in brief, to operate as a learning organization. School leaders need to be skilled in transformational leadership practices which work, directly and indirectly through others, towards bringing about: consensus in the organization's mission; structures for shared decision making; continual learning through reflective practice; high standards of professionalism; and, a supportive and appreciative climate that promotes a culture of trust and collaboration. The LOLSO research also demonstrates that schools can be identified as learning organizations as they establish sequentially systems and structures of operation that promote: a collaborative and trusting work environment; a shared and monitored mission; empowerment of its members to share decision-making, show initiative and take risks; and, on-going challenging and relevant professional development. These school factors of leadership and organizational learning are shown to influence what happens in the core business of the school; the teaching and learning. Value: The article answers two fundamental questions: Does the nature of the leadership and the level of organizational learning in schools contribute to school effectiveness and improvement in terms of the extent of students' participation in school, student academic self-concept and engagement with school? What is the nature of the relationship between non-academic student measures of participation in school, student self-concept and engagement with school and measures of student retention and academic achievement? © 2011 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

AB  - School leaders’ influence on student achievement is largely indirect. Using systematic review techniques, this paper assesses the impact that leaders have on their students when they focus their improvement efforts on those teacher emotions or dispositions known to have direct effects on teaching and learning in the classroom. Building on an earlier conceptions of how leadership influences student learning and based on a review of research over the last 25 years, this study identifies four distinct teacher emotions which have significant effects on student learning—collective teacher efficacy, teacher commitment, teacher trust in others, and Organizational Citizenship Behavior. This review also describes leadership practices likely to foster productive teacher emotions, most such practices reflecting a transformational approach to leadership. © 2015 by the author; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - This article explored the different clusters of leadership styles and the relationship between principal leadership style and student academic achievement in domains of mathematics, reading, science, and collaborative problem-solving in Germany and China. We used PISA 2015 data covering 6,504 students and 256 school principals from German schools and 9,841 students and 268 school leaders from Chinese schools. Results identified three leadership styles in Germany, namely, transformational (23.4%), instructional (41.3%), and integrated (35.3%) leadership, and two leadership styles in China, namely, transformational (38.6%) and instructional (61.4%) principals. Principals with instructional and integrated leadership had higher student achievements in Germany, whereas only principals with transformational leadership had slightly higher student achievements in China. Moreover, three leadership styles in Germany and two in China showed their relationships with each domain of student achievement. In conclusion, principals in Germany and China had different priorities in leading schools. The differences that principal leadership made on student achievements highlighted the differences in principals’ situational context and leading characteristics between Germany and China. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - School leadership has been identified as a key function in assuring quality in education. The instructional leadership model refers to the role and the functions of school leadership to employ different management tasks with regards to teaching and learning. Instructional leadership role includes (a) developing mission and goals, (b) managing the educational production function, (c) promoting an academic learning climate, and (d) developing a supportive work environment. Instructional leaders were described as leading from a combination of both expertise and charisma focused primarily on the improvement of student learning outcomes. The monograph, entitled Instructional Leadership and Effective Teaching and Learning and written by Nazmi Xhomara, is dedicated to school instructional leadership as an important factor that influences teaching and learning at school. In the first chapter, the author presents and analyzes educational leadership vs educational management, as well as models of educational leadership and management. The author argues on the importance of different leadership models, such as managerial leadership, transformational leadership, participative leadership, interpersonal leadership, transactional leadership, postmodern leadership, moral leadership, and contingent leadership. Chapters Two, Three, and Four shed light on instructional leadership and teaching and learning, understanding of instructional leadership, the concept and practice of instructional leadership, instructional school leadership and learning environment, attributes of instructional leaders, instructional excellence, instructional leadership time management, effective teaching and teachers, as well as teaching challenges and learning environment. Meanwhile, the author has analyzed constructivism, student intelligence, understanding of supervision, instructional collegial supervision, supervision approaches, understanding of evaluation of teaching and learning, teacher evaluation, and instructional observing instruments in chapters Five, Six, and Seven. Chapters Eight and Nine are focused especially on the research work of the relationships between instructional leadership and teaching, learning, and students' achievements, as well as on an empirical study designed and conducted in Albania as a case. Chapters Ten and Eleven are dedicated to instructional leadership preparation and the future of instructional leadership. As a conclusion, Xhomara indicates that principals are responsible for developing school climates and cultures that support the very best instructional practices. The new era of instructional leadership has predictably placed significant demands for accountability for student success and equity on the principal as well as for the university programs that prepare them. Working in twenty-first-century schools, the instructional leader is held more accountable than ever for student success. © 2021 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - The objective of this study is to explore which competencies predict leader effectiveness. Based on theory and job analysis, we observed the effects of five leaders' competencies (achievement orientation, problem analysis and problem solving, social sensitivity, influence, and integrity) on three indicators of effectiveness (perceived leader's effectiveness, leadership emergence, and team performance). Furthermore, we examined whether transformational leadership mediates these effects. We collected the data during an interuniversity student team competition. A total of 57 team leaders and 364 team members participated in the study. At the beginning of the competition, we measured the leaders' competencies through assessment centers. Each leader was assessed by 4 trained assessors in a one day long assessment center consisting of multiple individual and group model situations. After 6 months of teamwork, we measured the perceived leaders' effectiveness, leadership emergence and transformational leadership using questionnaires, and we estimated the teams' performance based on the ranking of the teams in the competition. The results show that leader achievement orientation is a significant predictor of perceived leader effectiveness, leadership emergence and team performance. The other four competencies do not predictieader effectiveness. There is no relation between competencies and transformational leadership; therefore, transformational leadership does not mediate the relation between competencies and effectiveness. The advantages of this study were that we obtained the data regarding the competencies and effectiveness from three different sources and that we measured competencies before the teamwork began. An average of more than 6 subordinates per leader ensures highly reliable evaluations of leaders' transformational leadership, perceived effectiveness and leadership emergence. The results can be applied to leader selection for short-term team projects.

Three empirical studies on teacher collaboration revealed positive correlations between teacher collaboration and student achievement. The literature on culture of inquiry and relevant theory from organizational management yielded five characteristics essential to a culture in which teachers plan and carry out professional development to evaluate and experiment with new teaching methods: transformational leadership, inquiry and healthy debate, license to experiment, collegiality and sharing, and an ongoing cycle of reflection. © 2017 SAGE Publications.

AB  - The relevance of school principals’ leadership behaviour in promoting school effectiveness and improvement is less discussed and known in emerging countries, explicitly in Sub-Saharan countries. Moreover, there is a significant inconclusive body of literature on the most dominant leadership model (instructional (IL) and transformational (TL) in determining the coherence of school improvement and student academic achievement. Hence, the current study extended the knowledge by examining the impact of IL and TL on implementing the School Improvement Programme (SIP) in the Ethiopian context designed to foster students’ academic performance. This study randomly sampled and surveyed 2880 public secondary school teachers and 70 principals. The study’s findings suggested that school principals’ personal information, gender, academic qualification, and leadership experience determine their leadership style, the coherence of SIP, and school performance. Unlike previous evidence, this study’s findings shed light on the principals’ IL and TL practice, which significantly impacted students’ academic achievement through the mediating role of coherent SIP. © 2025 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - This study aims to explore whether there is a relationship between the leadership style of school principals and the performance of their students. For this purpose, a multiple case study was developed in three private subsidized schools in a city on Northern Chile. The multiple case study included the application of a questionnaire, semi-structured interviews to members of the principal's work team who participated in the study in the three schools, and the consideration of the score obtained by the establishment in a test used for measuring learning outcomes (SIMCE test). Results suggest that in the case of the three schools, transformational leadership has a positive impact on student outcomes. Additionally, unlike what is stated in other studies, transactional leadership is also a key determinant for the achievement obtained by students. Thus, this exploratory research validates the dimensions of the styles of transformational and transactional leadership, contributing to new findings that allow continuing with quantitative larger studies.

AB  - Educational leaders have been held increasingly accountable for demonstrating significant gains in student achievement in the wake of education reform policies such as No Child Left Behind. This achievement is often defined as positive gains in attendance and test scores as discipline referrals and suspension numbers decrease. Socioeconomic and cultural contributions to student achievement are often relegated to secondary analyses, are used as deficit explanations when achievement is not increased, or are ignored completely. While this approach may give a snapshot of conditions at a given moment, it does not provide program evaluators with enough information to appropriately assess the implementation of interventions. This qualitative study examines the implementation and evaluation of a prosocial intervention in 10 schools serving American Indian families designed to reflect the culture of program participants and community stakeholders. Findings of the study demonstrate that the relationship between leadership and evaluation participants improved as they worked as partners rather than in isolation. Additionally, gains in prosocial student behavior were observed when traditional evaluation methods were suspended for more culturally appropriate methods that allowed for greater collaboration and timely modifications based on emerging research. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - This research aimed to examine the causal relationship model of primary school students' achievement. The coverage included all types of primary public schools, namely formal and extended primary, in urban and rural areas, respectively, throughout Thailand. A survey was carried out with 1,200 school administrators and teachers from 600 schools with the intention of testing the goodness of fit of the causal relationship model with the empirical data. Results disclosed that the causal relationship model of students' achievement were identified as congruous with empirical data, with χ2 =58.381, df = 45, χ2/df = 1.307, CFI = 1.000, TLI = 0.999, RMSEA = 0.016, and SRMR = 0.007. In addition, the three main variables, namely teachers' collective efficacy, transformational leadership, and professional learning community, significantly affected students' achievement, directly and positively. On top of that, transformational leadership significantly affected both the variables of teachers' collective efficacy and professional learning community; the professional learning community significantly affected teachers' collective efficacy directly and positively. Finally, the test of invariability of the linear causal relationship model of students' achievement indicated that the two models, in either formal primary school or extended primary, were found to have the goodness of fit with the empirical data. Results contribute significantly to knowledge by proposing the causal relationship model to provide a connection between the three key factors, namely transformational leadership, professional learning community, and teachers' collective efficacy, to improve primary school students' achievement. © Universiti Putra Malaysia Press

AB  - One hundred fifty-one Chinese participants rated scales on perceived transformational and change leadership, and perceived conditions of leadership (e.g., leadership experience, interpersonal competence, adaptor-innovator style, achievement goal orientation, and personality). The participants perceived highly their transformational leadership styles. Interpersonal competence was the strongest predictor of transformational and change leadership. Gender was found to be a significant predictor of transformational leadership (both for articulating the vision and fostering the acceptance of group goals). Kirton's originality subscale could predict transformational leadership (articulating the vision). Conscientiousness proved to be a significant predictor of transformational and change leadership. Females rated higher on leadership scales than males, which seems to predispose them to exert transformational and change leadership style in organizations. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to reveal the extent to which different leadership models in education are studied, including the change in the trends of research on each model over time, the most prominent scholars working on each model, and the countries in which the articles are based. The analysis of the related literature was conducted by first employing a bibliometric analysis of the research and review papers indexed in the Web of Science database between 1980 and 2014. Then, a more in-depth analysis of selected papers was done using the content analysis method. The results showed that there has been increasing interest in leadership models in educational research over time. Distributed leadership, instructional leadership, teacher leadership, and transformational leadership are the most studied leadership models in educational research. It was also found that related research increasingly focuses on the effects of leaders on organizational behaviors/conditions and on student achievement. Accordingly, usage of quantitative methodology has significantly increased during the last decade. Possible reasons for these changes, implications, and recommendations for future research are also discussed. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.

AB  - The study investigated whether students perceive their university instructors in a virtual learning environment as leaders. Referring to the full range leadership theory (FRLT), we examined the effects of transformational and passive leadership styles of university instructors on students' satisfaction and learning outcomes. Completed web-based questionnaires were obtained from 1270 students who enrolled in large academic courses led by instructors in web-based instructional environments. Data analyses confirmed the validity of the multifactor leadership questionnaire (MLQ) in the virtual asynchronous communication setting with three second-order factors model composed of transformational, active management-by-exception and passive leadership. Leadership styles correlated with student satisfaction: the more the students attributed transformational leadership style to the instructor and the less they attributed a passive leadership style, the more satisfied they were. The attributed leadership style was not related to the actual participation of the students in the virtual discussions or to their academic achievements. The findings suggest that subordinates' satisfaction might be tied more strongly to their perception of the leader than to the actual tangible benefits the leader can provide. Moreover, the study shows that the FRLT is applied to the asynchronous, web-based, instructional environment which is being increasingly adopted in higher education institutions. © The Author(s) 2013.

AB  - The focus of this chapter is to highlight two different transformational change initiatives in public.schools that rely on student leadership to be effective. Both programs will explore effective ways to empower students as leaders, to make better social decisions, and to improve their attachment to school and community. One program involves a student-led technology club in a middle school. The goal of the club is to assist with the school's technology usage while also making a positive impact on participating students ' achievement and attachment to school. The other program involves educating high school students on the risks of heroin and opioid addiction. Both programs seek to leverage student empowerment to induce long-term, positive behavior change in the students directly involved as well as those around them. © 2021, IGI Global.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this study was to examine the ways principals in three high-needs middle schools enacted core leadership practices in concert with their immediate contexts to institutionalize comprehensive school reforms and support student learning. Research Methods: The schools were selected from a geographically stratified sample of public middle schools in a state in the southeastern United States. Multiple linear regression was used to identify schools performing better than expected considering their levels of poverty and other school-related factors. The final three schools, one from each geographic region, showed steady increases in academic achievement and school climate following the arrival of their principals. Data were primarily collected from interviews with principals, teaching and nonteaching staff, and parents using protocols adapted from the International Successful School Principalship Project. Findings: The findings explicate the large degree to which the leadership practices and beliefs that influenced student achievement in these schools were adapted to and commensurate with each school's immediate context. Furthermore, they illustrate how principals used these practices to institutionalize school-wide reform efforts as vehicles for leading change within their schools. Implications: The findings substantiate research on successful school leadership in high-needs middle schools. They also extend this research by examining the way core transformational and instructional leadership practices can be adapted to suit various school contexts and institutionalize school-wide reform efforts to enhance student learning. Further research is required to understand how principals decide to adapt their leadership practices, and how aspiring leaders can best learn to do so. © The University Council for Educational Administration 2013.

AB  - Background: Using meta-analytic review techniques, this study synthesized the results of 79 unpublished studies about the nature of transformational school leadership (TSL) and its impact on the school organization, teachers, and students. This corpus of research associates TSL with 11 specific leadership practices. These practices, as a whole, have moderate positive effects on a wide range of consequential school conditions. They also have moderately strong and positive effects on individual teachers' internal states, followed by their influence on teacher behaviors and collective teachers' internal states. TSL has small but significant positive effects on student achievement. Research Design: This synthesis of unpublished research results is accomplished by a systematic series of meta-correlations and is compared with the results of earlier systematic reviews of published TSL research. Findings: Among the conclusions arising from the study is that several of the most widely advocated models of effective educational leadership actually include many of the same practices. Conclusions: More attention by researchers, practitioners, and researchers needs to be devoted to the impact of specific leadership practices and less to leadership models. © The University Council for Educational Administration 2012.

AB  - This empirical research is about strengths-based leadership practices that seek to explore leadership for social justice and equity in New Zealand’s culturally and linguistically diverse educational and social landscape. Similar to the diversity in other countries, where leaders demonstrate culturally responsive leadership practices in their quest to educate diverse democracies. This inquiry examines the characteristics and behaviours of effective leadership for social justice and equity for student academic achievement in urban Auckland primary schools. A qualitative, comparative case study, combined with the theoretical framework of applied critical leadership from theories of transformational leadership, critical pedagogy and critical race theory (perspective lens) guided the research methods. The research findings presented several applied critical leadership characteristics that highlighted the complexities of leading for social justice in urban Auckland primary schools. A distinct phenomenon was leader’s axiological philosophy (values, beliefs and morals) underpinning their leadership that was culturally responsive to the diversity in their educational contexts. These findings suggest the need for research and scholarship yet to be done in this largely unexplored educational leadership academic space. © 2016 by the author; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - As studies capable of establishing a mediating role of transformational classroom leadership between transformational school leadership and students' learning achievement are short in supply in the Thai high school context, this quantitative study aimed to investigate this role and compared the students' learning achievement among different school sizes. A total of 199 teachers, who taught O-NET and PISA key subjects-45 teachers in English, 77 teachers in science, 77 teachers in math-from the five regions of Thailand representing small, medium, and large school size were recruited through a stratified sampling technique and were asked to rate their principal's transformational school leadership and own transformational classroom leadership. A Thai version of the transformational leadership questionnaire was developed, which consisted of a self-rating and a rater form. Partial Least Square Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) was employed to find the causal relationship, and ANOVA version SPSS 21 was used to compare the SLA among three different school sizes. The study found that transformational school leadership had direct effects on transformational classroom leadership, but transformational classroom leadership did not have a direct effect on English, science, and math teaching. The study also found that large schools had better students' learning achievement compared to small and medium-sized schools, and small-sized schools had the lowest average score in English, science, and math. Based on these new findings, the study made guidelines for the Thai Ministry of Education, Thai school principals, and Thai teachers. © Common Ground Research Networks, Danty James, Patreeya Kitcharoen, All Rights Reserved.

AB  - This statewide study examined the relationships between principal managerial, instructional, and transformational leadership and student achievement in public high schools. Differences in student achievement were found when schools were grouped according to principal leadership factors. Principal leadership behaviors promoting instructional and curriculum improvement were linked to achievement. Within transformational leadership, the principal's ability to identify a vision and provide an appropriate model had the greatest relationship to achievement. Principal educational level also positively correlated with each leadership factor. © 2011 SAGE Publications.

AB  - In this meta-analysis study, different leadership styles were combined, and the relationship between educational leadership and student achievement was analyzed. In the literature review, 57 research articles/dissertations, independent from one another, were brought together, and 28,964 study subjects were included in the sample group. The results of the analyses performed with a random effects model revealed that educational leadership has a medium effect on students’ achievement. As was expected, the most comprehensive effect among leadership styles was found in distributive and transformational leadership. Considering the effect of educational leadership on students’ achievement, it is recommended to examine the effect of leadership on other components of school and shareholders in future studies. © 2015, Education Research Institute, Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea.

AB  - Purpose – Greater understanding about how variables mediate the relationship between leadership and achievement is essential to the success of reform efforts that hold leaders accountable for student learning. The purpose of this paper is to test a model of integrated transformational leadership including three important school mediators. Design/methodology/approach – In total, 5,392 students provided data on student engagement, and 569 teachers provided survey data on principal leadership and the collective teacher efficacy (CTE) and extra effort of their colleagues. Data were analyzed at the school level (n=51) using mediation analysis with the PROCESS macro to calculate the direct and indirect effects of all of the variables in the serial multiple mediator model. Findings – The model explained a significant amount of variance in both reading (38 percent) and mathematics (35 percent). CTE and student engagement mediated all of the leadership effects, demonstrating the importance of teacher and student relations in school improvement. The combined effect sizes are significantly greater than the effects of earlier TL models. Originality/value – This study contributes to “leadership for learning” research by demonstrating that refining transformational leadership behaviors to include instructional management can enhance a leader’s impact on achievement. As one of the few studies to examine student engagement as a mediator along with teacher mediators, the current study highlights the importance of teacher-student relations in school improvement. While collective efficacy mediated all of the effects of leadership on achievement, student emotional engagement also contributed to mathematics achievement. The study’s findings advance research into mutual influence processes, indicating that reciprocity may extend throughout the leader-teacher-student loop. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - This study investigates the cultural and ideological underpinnings of educational leadership within higher education institutions (HEIs) and assesses their impact on fostering innovation in teaching and management. Our research reveals a nuanced relationship between varied leadership styles, institutional cultures, and the drive for innovation. Notably, transformational leadership aligns strongly with innovative outcomes and a collaborative institutional ethos, in contrast to the more rigid structures associated with authoritarian and laissez-faire leadership styles. The philosophical core of this inquiry lies in examining how leadership practices embody and promote ethical values that influence collective and individual success. Institutions that cultivate a culture of collaboration and are open to embracing risk are found to be more conducive to innovation. In contrast, settings that emphasize rigid hierarchies and prioritize individual achievement tend to stifle creative and innovative practices. Our findings emphasize the crucial role of leaders in shaping an ethical climate that nurtures innovation. Effective leadership is pivotal in fostering an environment supportive of progressive teaching and management strategies. This includes investing in faculty development, enhancing collaborative efforts, and acknowledging academic excellence. Moreover, the strategic integration of technology and a shift towards student-centred learning are identified as essential for advancing innovative teaching practices. By delving into the philosophical and ethical dimensions of educational leadership, this study contributes to a deeper understanding of how leadership rooted in ethical and collaborative values can profoundly impact educational innovation and success. The insights gained underscore the potential for educational leaders to drive significant change by adhering to philosophically and ethically sound practices. © (2024), (European Journal for Philosophy of Religion).

AB  - The increasing view that “traditional, hierarchical views of leadership are less and less useful given the complexities of our modern world” (Lichtenstein et al., Emergence: Complexity and Organization 8:2–12, 2006) and the heightened level of complexity in Africa necessitate an understanding of leadership that is humanistic, the process by which an individual in a leadership role influences others to achieve desire goals through human-centred principles of trust, ethicality, compassion, and engagement. Humanistic leadership has been part of Africa since the pre-modern era (i.e., ancient Egypt) through the Maat philosophy. Maat is a philosophy of the people of ancient Kemet or black Egypt. It “is a fundamental, pervasive, and enduring element in ancient Egyptian civilization and an inclusive and defining cultural category” (Karenga, Maât. The moral ideal in ancient Egypt: A study in classical African ethics, Routledge, 2004). Such leadership is particularly significant in this era of the Africa Union Agenda 2063, which views one of the critical success factors for the achievement of the agenda as “leadership and political commitment with transformational and visionary qualities at all levels and in all fields.” This view is also encapsulated in the World Economic Forum which indicates that “Africa doesn’t need charity, it needs good leadership.” In addition, the Mo Ibrahim Foundation, advocates effective leadership in Africa, established an award for good national leaders and a proprietary index that gauges the quality of governance and leadership in African countries (Mo Ibrahim Foundation, Governance progress in Africa stalling, reports Mo Ibrahim, 2015). This award has not been won in eight of the twelve years because no leader has been found worthy of the award. The chapter integrates historical, anthropological, and philosophical accounts of leadership in Africa to situate humanistic leadership in modern Africa. The framework is limited to the period before the colonial eras of Africa (i.e., the Kemetic era). Following a brief review of extant leadership in Africa, I discuss the Maatian view of humanistic leadership. Leveraging that historical perspective, I discuss exemplars of humanistic leaders in modern Africa. Three such leaders are Nelson Mandela (Glad and Blanton, Presidential Studies Quarterly 27:565–590, 1997; Pietersen, Leader to Leader 2015:60–66, 2015), Desmond Tutu (Blankstein et al., Excellence through equity: Five principles of courageous leadership to guide achievement for every student. ASCD, 2016), James Mwangi of Equity Bank of Kenya (Chironga et al., Leadership lessons from Africa’s trailblazers. McKinsey Quarterly, 1–10, 2019). While Nelson Mandela and Desmond Tutu epitomize the Ubuntu principles of humanism, James Nwangi exemplifies the Maatian humanistic principles. Both the traditional or ancient view of humanistic leadership which is illustrated with modern leaders affords an opportunity for scholars conducting research on humanistic leadership in Africa to ground their studies in Indigenous philosophical and humanistic principles. Humanistic leadership is proposed as a function of decisions and actions of African traditional orientations that derive from Maat philosophy. This perspective unearths the source of modern understanding of humanistic leadership and reorients the field of leadership development and prevention of bad leadership as they relate to management of organizations in Africa. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.

AB  - Transformational leadership is one of the models for the initial change that can encourage Madrasah Aliyah to excel, both at the national and international levels. This study is a qualitative study with an interactive analysis model on transformational leadership strategies at the international Madrasah Aliyah Amanatul Ummah Mojokerto and the Serpong Insan Cendekia State Madrasah Aliyah. This study concluded that the first strategy to increase the influence of the idealism of the madrasah principal towards an international pesantren-based Madrasah Aliyah is the strong commitment between the principal and teachers, employees, students, as well as parents, beginning with planning (RKM) using school review, quality assurance, benchmarking, and quality control accompanied by exemplary values, an effort to maintain mutual trust as well as the sincerity of all stakeholders. Then, the second strategy is to foster inspirational motivation for the principals of international pesantren-based Madrasah Aliyah which is reflected in the ability of madrasah principals who can motivate and inspire their subordinates to improve the quality of education together. For example, the achievement of madrasah principals, teachers and students winning the international olympiad between 2010-2020 is supported by the principle of Islamic boarding school that is ‘The Islamic Role Model is The First Key to Build Great Leaders’. Furthermore, The third strategy is to strengthen the intellectual stimulus of Madrasah Aliyah’s principal with superior international standards based on Islamic boarding school values, which is reflected in several positive changes made and achieved by the madrasah’s principal, both the quality of the input, process, and output, such as student achievements in national and international levels such as scholarships to the Middle East, Europe, Japan, and Australia. Finally, the last strategy is to transform the madrasah principal’s individualized considereation towards superior international pesantren-based Madrasah Aliyah which is reflected in the ability of madrasah principals in managing human resources appropriately, including managing the right competencies for human resources through the competency development programs for teachers and employees continuously; and improving abilities through training supported by the principles of responsibility and exemplary, which are the characteristics of pesantren. © 2021

AB  - Early childhood education has long been connected with objectives related to social justice. Australian early childhood education and care (ECEC) has its roots in philanthropic and educational reform movements prevalent at the turn of the twentieth century. More recently, with the introduction of the National Early Childhood Reform Agenda, early childhood education has once more been linked to the achievement of aims associated with redressing inequality and disadvantage. The authors argue that educational leaders have an obligation to promote equity as they articulate the needs of marginalised students who are traditionally disadvantaged while they also work towards challenging the social order that affords this circumstance of inequity to exist. Drawing on extant literature, including data from two previously reported Australian studies in which leadership emerged as having a transformational impact on service delivery, this article examines the potential of early childhood leadership to generate 'socially just' educational communities. With reference to critical theory, the authors argue that critically informed, intentional and strategic organisational leadership can play a pivotal role in creating changed circumstances and opportunities for children and families. Such leadership includes positional and distributed elements, articulation of values and beliefs, and collective action that is mindful and informed.

AB  - Educational psychology usually focuses on explaining phenomena. As a result, researchers seldom explore how well their models predict the outcomes they care about using best-practice approaches to predictive statistics. In this paper, we focus less on explanation and more on prediction, showing how both are important for advancing the field. We apply predictive models to the role of teachers on student engagement, i.e. the thoughts, attitudes, and behaviours, that translate motivation into progress. We integrate the suggestions from four prominent motivational theories (self-determination theory, achievement goal theory, growth mindset theory, and transformational leadership theory), and aim to identify those most critical behaviours for predicting changes in students’ engagement in physical education. Students (N = 1324 all from year 7, 52% girls) from 17 low socio-economic status schools rated their teacher’s demonstration of 71 behaviours in the middle of the school year. We also assessed students’ engagement at the beginning and end of the year. We trained elastic-net regression models on 70% of the data and then assessed their predictive validity on the held-out data (30%). The models showed that teacher behaviours predicted 4.39% of the variance in students’ change in engagement. Some behaviours that were most consistently associated with a positive change in engagement were being good role models (β = 0.046), taking interest in students’ lives outside of class (β = 0.033), and allowing students to make choices (β = 0.029). The influential behaviours did not neatly fit within any single motivational theory. These findings support arguments for integrating different theoretical approaches, and suggest practitioners may want to consider multiple theories when designing interventions. More generally, we argue that researchers in educational psychology should more frequently test how well their models not just explain, but predict the outcomes they care about. © 2023, Crown.

AB  - This quantitative study explores the relationship between school leadership and the development and sustenance of teacher social capital. The literature review discusses aspects of leadership theory to elucidate understanding of how leadership influences teachers’ working relationships. Quantitative methodology and analyses ascertain the correlation between Leithwood et al.’s dimensions of transformational leadership and the author’s dimensions of teacher social capital. Study findings indicate significant, positive moderate to high moderate correlations between: (1) transformational leadership and the environmental conditions nurturing teacher social capital; (2) leadership and teacher social capital; and (3) leadership and teacher collective efficacy (TCE). An additional major finding is the perception of higher levels of transformational leadership among teachers in middle performing and high performing schools as compared to the perceptions of teachers in low performing schools. This study provides evidence of the importance of transformational leadership in the development of teacher social capital within a school. High levels of teacher social capital should result in positive outcomes of student achievement, teacher quality and teacher job satisfaction. The study findings, interpretations and conclusions contribute to both school leadership and school improvement literature and should inform discussions about leadership development and the impact of leadership on teacher working relationships. © 2013, SAGE Publications.

AB  - Learning outcomes: Analyze: Examine the role of cultural fit in job satisfaction and organizational effectiveness, using theoretical frameworks such as Hofstede’s Cultural Dimensions and Person–Organization Fit Theory. Analyze how ShowVista’s opaque decision-making and performance metrics, leadership communication and recognition practices influenced Brown’s engagement and performance. Evaluate: Assess the impact of recognition, or the lack thereof, on employee motivation and retention using Herzberg’s Two-Factor Theory and Self-Determination Theory. Create: Design actionable strategies for Brown to navigate cultural and organizational challenges, incorporating tools such as cultural intelligence and transformational leadership principles. Synthesize: Integrate insights from organizational behavior and HR theories to develop a comprehensive plan for ShowVista, addressing both individual and systemic challenges. Reflect: Encourage students to introspect on their personal values and cultural adaptability, drawing parallels between Brown’s dilemma and their own potential career challenges. Case overview/synopsis: In “Cultural Collisions: The Struggle for Recognition in a Cross-Cultural Workplace,” Alex Brown, the National Marketing Head at ShowVista, faces mounting frustration as his contributions to the company’s success go unrecognized. Despite spearheading innovative marketing strategies that boosted revenue, Brown finds himself sidelined in an organization where hierarchy, consensus-driven decision-making and relationship-based leadership take precedence over individual achievement. ShowVista’s Indian-influenced corporate culture clashes with Brown’s results-oriented, recognition-driven mindset, leaving him isolated and undervalued. His attempts to implement data-driven approaches are met with resistance, while credit for his successes is often attributed to senior executives. The strain of navigating an unfamiliar work culture, compounded by personal sacrifices, forces Brown to question his future at the company. As he stands at a crossroads, he must decide whether to adapt to ShowVista’s norms or seek an organization that aligns with his values. The case examines the complexities of cultural fit, leadership role in a multicultural organization and career identity in a global workplace.

AB  - This article presents a study on the extent to which the leadership of Brazilian school principals has helped improve students’ achievements as reflected by the results of external evaluations of schools. The study sought to measure leadership dimensions based on microdata from contextual questionnaires answered by principals and teachers; propose a model that relates leadership dimensions to student achievement as reflected by schools’ IDEB results; and verify the relationships between leadership dimensions and student achievement. To that end, we performed multivariate analyzes, specifically structural equations modeling, on a database containing microdata from Prova Brasil and IDEB values. Results show that it is possible to measure leadership dimensions using these microdata. Based on the conceptual model developed, there is evidence that the relationships developed by the principal within the school have a greater effect on teachers’ commitment to improve teaching and learning, thus indirectly affecting school performance. In addition, school principals have sought to exercise transformational leadership combined with pedagogical leadership, which represents a challenge for them, since it covers many knowledge areas. © 2019, Arizona State University.

AB  - In 2013, Abertay University undertook a root and branch review of pedagogic policies and practices, catalysed by the university’s new teaching and learning enhancement strategy. What is quite remarkable about these changes is their extent and the pace of their implementation. Transformation have included: curriculum (module credit size, new electives, portfolio review, programme redesign), assessment and feedback (electronic management of assessment, new literal grading scale, introduction of GPA and the Higher Education Achievement Report, HEAR), and academic staff development (revised postgraduate certificate in teaching, new accredited CPD scheme, funding for teaching innovation and creating a new, strong community of practice). The university’s size (4000 students, 200 academic staff) has been a helpful factor, however, key has been a novel change management approach developed by the Abertay senior team. This approach can be summarised as 6Ps: Purpose, Principles, Participation, Practice, Pace, and Pre-mortem. This chapter explores the academic leadership and management aspects of the transformational changes introduced, the processes adopted, the success of the strategy’s implementation, and how leaders and managers were supported throughout the process by a programme of university-provided structured CPD. Finally, the authors reflect on the challenges and wider lessons learned of this major institutional initiative. © 2020 selection and editorial matter, Jackie Potter and Cristina Devecchi; individual chapters, the contributors.

AB  - One of the challenging issues that educational organizations in developing countries face in staffing classrooms with qualified teachers is the high rate of teachers’ turnover. It creates problems for schools, which eventually leads to substandard instruction and low student achievement. This research explores the causes of English teachers’ turnover in a Non-Government Educational Organization in Kabul, Afghanistan. The results indicate that lack of teachers’ motivation, low salary, communication gap between management and teachers, market opportunities for English teachers, workload, absence of career path and weak recruitment processes are the major factors contributing to teachers’ turnover in Afghanistan. The high teachers’ turnover leads to such negative effects as interruptions in learning process, behavioural adjustment of students with new teachers, continuous exposure of students with novice teachers, emotional detachments of students with their teachers and negative effects on students’ learning. The article concludes that educational organizations should deal with their teachers more humanely. Teachers retain and perform in an organization when they are valued, motivated and satisfied with their jobs and their professional status. In the absence of such environment, it is likely that educational organizations in Afghanistan would continue to struggle to attract and retain qualified teachers, which will eventually compromise on the achievements of their students. Considering the findings, creation of covenantal bond rather than contractual bond is suggested as a strategy that could be augmented by a transformational leadership, which can motivate the teachers to remain committed to their profession. © The Author(s) 2015.

AB  - Effective educational leadership is essential for the success of schools and ultimately student achievement. The impact of school leadership may be even more pronounced in charter schools. Due to current and unprecedented growth, unique design, and complexities of political, financial, and governance issues they face, there is a need for more highly qualified charter school leaders and perhaps even “differently” prepared leaders. In this qualitative study, the authors documented the characteristics and skills of two successful, sustained charter school leaders who retrospectively described their evolved and evolving roles over twenty five years. Each transformed high-poverty, low-performing schools with at-risk populations and led with vision, passion, and a relentless desire to positively influence their organizations and ultimately improve student success in their communities. Although many of their skills and characteristics fall within existing theories, such as situational leadership, transformational leadership, and distributive leadership, they embodied a level of dedication and commitment to the original communities in which they founded charters lasting over a quarter of a century. The findings suggest that founding a charter school and seeing it through to success over time may more closely resemble missionary work than traditional school leadership. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - This work is part of a wider research effort in the field of leadership and organizational development, coordinated by the University of Granada and the A.R.E.A Research Group (Analysis of Educational Reality in Andaluz), HUM/672. It was developed in the Cooperative University of Colombia, a country where technical and technological programmes have been promoted in the past 10 years through institutions of higher education. We build on the idea that knowing the leadership styles of teachers and principals is fundamental. The main objective of the study is thus to formulate achievement strategies to improve the educative centre and the educational community at several levels: as individuals, as groups and as an organization. To this aim we conducted a descriptive research with a non-experimental design by the poll method, through the implementation of the ‘Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire by Bass and Avolio–MLQ’ instrument, administered to teachers and principals of technical-technological programmes of the Cooperative University of Colombia. Results show that the elements of Transformational Leadership are predominant over the other types of Leadership. They thus emerge as the key element to strengthen, through individual training processes and organizational improvement strategies, in order to achieve optimal organizational results. This must be carried out from within the educational entity, through the motivation of students and work groups, strengthening the practices of teachers and principals in the development of basic organizational and academic functions. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Leadership style is an important aspect in students’ academic performance in schools. Transformational leadership style is associated with the students’ academic achievement in KCSE. The study sought to establish the relationship between idealized influence of principals’ transformational leadership style and students’ academic performance in KCSE in Bomet County in Kenya. The descriptive survey design was used for this study whose target population comprised of 130 secondary schools and five Quality Assurance and Standards Officers in Bomet County. Stratified random sampling procedure was adopted to sample out schools as boys’, girls’ and mixed schools; then Slovin’s formula was used to obtain a total of 108 schools. While purposive sampling procedure was applied to choose one Director of Studies from each 108 schools selected and five Quality Assurance and Standards Officers from the five sub-counties in Bomet County. A total sample of 118 respondents from 108 secondary schools and the five sub-counties participated in the study. When collecting the data, instruments used were Director of Studies’ questionnaires, Quality Assurance and Standards Officers’ interview guides, school and Bomet County Director of Education KCSE records. Chi-square test was adopted to establish the relationship between principals’ idealized influence and academic performance and the results showed that principals’ idealized influence had a strong significant relationship with students’ academic performance in KCSE. Thus, idealized influence characteristics are most effective in promoting students’ academic achievement. The study recommends that the idealized influence should be adopted and displayed by principals in order to improve academic performance in KCSE examinations.

AB  - The quality of school leaders and teachers is critical to both school development and student achievement. Thus, quality school leaders are needed for teachers to perform their assigned roles and tasks in line with the school goals. This paper examined the effect of transformational leadership behaviours of school principals on teacher agency. The study adopted a correlational research method and was conducted with 349 teachers working in primary, middle, and secondary schools of 15 cities located in eastern, central, and western Anatolia regions. Based on the variables observed in the school, path analysis was applied to analyse the relationships between implicit variables. A direct relationship was found between the transformational leadership practice of school principals and teachers’ behaviours. In addition, transformational leadership practices of school principals had a direct as well as a moderate effect on teacher agency; teacher self-efficacy led to an indirect increase on this effect. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Persistence for achievement reflected from the willingness and determination of principal to implement quality leadership will facilitate the improvement of teachers’ performance, and the two will be the determinant factors for the students’ ultimate achievement. This study aims at analyzing empirical data on the effect of instructional, transformational and spiritual leadership as independent variables, with school quality as the dependent variable. In addition, the intervening variable is teachers’ performance. This study employed the quantitative approach in which samples of 181 teachers were re taken using the proportional random sampling technique. All data were then analysed using the SEM technique with the AMOS 24 application. The findings show that: (1) there is a direct effect of instructional leadership on teachers’ performance, transformational leadership on teachers’ performance, spiritual leadership on teachers’ performance, instructional leadership on students’ achievement, transformational leadership on students’ achievement, spiritual leadership on students’ achievement, and teachers’ performance on students’ achievement. In addition, (2) there is an indirect effect of instructional leadership on students’ achievement through teachers’ performance, transformational leadership on students’ achievement through teachers’ performance and spiritual leadership on students’ achievement through teachers’ performance. © 2021, Universitas Negeri Yogyakarta (Yogyakarta State University).

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this article is to detail the results of a large survey based research project which sough to examine the relationships among leadership, organizational learning and teacher and student outcomes.Design A large survey based on questionnaires developed from non-school organizations was used to develop a model to test the nature and strength of the relationships between variables and to understand the interactive nature of leadership and organizational learning and their effects on student outcomes. Model testing employed a latent variables partial least squares path analysis procedure.Findings The results of research have shown that leadership characteristics of a school are important factors in promoting systems and structures that enable the school to be effective and improve, in brief, to operate as a learning organization. School leaders need to be skilled in transformational leadership practices which work, directly and indirectly through others, towards bringing about: consensus in the organization's mission; structures for shared decision making; continual learning through reflective practice; high standards of professionalism; and, a supportive and appreciative climate that promotes a culture of trust and collaboration. The LOLSO research also demonstrates that schools can be identified as learning organizations as they establish sequentially systems and structures of operation that promote: a collaborative and trusting work environment; a shared and monitored mission; empowerment of its members to share decision-making, show initiative and take risks; and, on-going challenging and relevant professional development. These school factors of leadership and organizational learning are shown to influence what happens in the core business of the school; the teaching and learning.Value The article answers two fundamental questions: Does the nature of the leadership and the level of organizational learning in schools contribute to school effectiveness and improvement in terms of the extent of students' participation in school, student academic self-concept and engagement with school? What is the nature of the relationship between non-academic student measures of participation in school, student self-concept and engagement with school and measures of student retention and academic achievement? © 2011 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

AB  - Successful implementation of school-wide interventions (i.e., delivered to all students by a wide array of school personnel) is key to promoting students’ academic achievement and psychosocial development. Yet, the implementation of school-wide interventions is complex and can be psychologically taxing for implementing personnel. If evidence-based practice and program (EBP) implementation goes unsupported, implementation challenges might result in chronic stress among school personnel that leads to burnout. While generally effective leadership tends to decrease educator burnout, implementation-specific leadership may also decrease burnout through its strategic supports for EBP implementation. A series of linear regression and path models were used to examine the concurrent association between transformational (e.g., general) and implementation (e.g., strategic) leadership and burnout and its component parts (i.e., emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, personal accomplishment). In a sample of 338 school personnel, we found transformational and implementation leadership were each significantly associated with decreased burnout. However, transformational leadership was not significantly associated with any of the three burnout components, whereas implementation leadership was significantly associated with increased personal accomplishment. These results suggest both general and strategic forms of leadership are key supports for school personnel burnout and as such, leaders may benefit from training to improve each. Additional implications for schools and future directions to understand how best to support school personnel are discussed. © 2023 American Psychological Association

AB  - This research scrutinized the scientometric objectivity of school leadership research in Asia. Publication records between 2018 and 2022 were extracted from Scopus and the Web of Science, after which the bibliographic data set was administered using ScientoPy and VOSviewer. A total of 958 publications were issued over the last five years, with 2020 having the highest number of published articles. The International Journal of Innovation, Creativity and Change was the most productive source (26 papers), Hallinger was the most published author, and “Examining school leadership effects on student achievement: the role of contextual challenges and constraints” had the most significant impact with 33 citations. The top 10 keywords were “leadership,” “higher education,” “transformational leadership,” “principal,” “education,” “school principals,” “school leadership,” “instructional leadership,” “educational leadership,” and “organizational commitment.” With 240 publications, Indonesia was Asia’s leading contributor in this research domain. The results indicated that school leadership research is important. It is recommended that future researchers extend this research to other regions, such as Africa, North America, South America, Antarctica, Europe, and Australia, to gain a fuller picture of school leadership studies across the world. © 2023, Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

AB  - The study investigated how principals and assistant principals perceived their school discipline policies and their impact on student achievement. The investigator conducted a mixed method study using a survey questionnaire (to include research developed questions and questions from the Belief on Discipline Survey) and an open-ended question. The study examined principals and assistant principals who lead in secondary schools in northern Florida and assessed differences in the implementation of discipline policies between high poverty low-achieving (HPLA) and high poverty high-achieving (HPHA) schools and the impact on student achievement. The study also examined the factors these principals and assistant principals perceived as facilitating and hindering discipline policy. Descriptive statistics were used to examine demographic data. The study used a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) to assess differences in the perceived impact of school discipline policies on student achievement between principals and assistant principals (APs) at HPHA schools and HPLA schools. Qualitative data were analyzed using the constant comparative method. The results of this study suggest there were significant differences in the characteristics of principals and APs serving high poverty (HP) schools, differences in how principals and APs in HP schools perceive their discipline practices in relationship to student success. Also, the findings suggest there are some differences in the qualities of transformational leadership (TL) between principals and APs HPHA and HPLA schools. © Common Ground Research Networks, Gari D.

AB  - Purpose: Systems educational reform in developing countries through effective principal capacity- building programs is essential for improving student learning, with the purpose of this paper being to use case studies to identify key success factors in the implementation of an instructional leadership program in the developing country of Kiribati. Design/methodology/approach: A case study approach involving mixed methods including semi-structured interviews and document analysis was used within three purposively sampled schools to examine implementation success factors relevant to instructional leadership literature Findings: The case studies reveal the overall value of the Kiribati instructional leadership program involving school leader workshops and ongoing coaching support, with instructional leadership reflecting directive and collaborative, as well as transformative theoretical aspects. Key implementation success factors within researched schools were leaders undertaking regular observations in classrooms, systematic tracking of student achievement and nurturing a positive culture for learning, as well as establishment of various collaborative processes involving community and teacher peer learning groups. Research limitations/implications: The study provides in-depth information through teacher and school leader interviews and examining relevant school documentation artefacts. A limitation is that the study involved only three schools and was undertaken less than a year into program implementation. Future research involving more schools and several years after implementation would be beneficial to investigate sustainability across the school system and longer-term program impacts. Practical implications: The data provides practical tips for school leaders regarding effective teacher capacity-building approaches, as well as providing information for policy makers, especially in developing countries, about effective professional development programs for school leaders and teachers. 10; 10; Originality/value: The study examines a system-wide workshop series and coaching approach to school leader and teacher capacity-building in a developing country from a theoretical and practical perspective relevant to instructional leadership and also transformational leadership, which is an under-researched area. 10; 10; 10; © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - The principal's leadership style is one of the most common ways of conceptualizing school leadership behaviours. We lack understanding, however, of how the effectiveness of school leadership styles varies across degrees of challenging circumstances. Data obtained from a quantitative survey of primary school teachers in Israel (N = 570) and from the Ministry of Education database were used to account for principals' leadership styles and their effectiveness in schools facing more challenging circumstances (N = 15) and in those facing less challenging circumstances (N = 46). Differences were found in the relations between principals' transactional behaviours on one hand and the teaching dimension of school culture and principals' perceived effectiveness on the other, as a function of challenging school circumstances. The study also found a difference in the relations of principals' transformational behaviours and the safety dimension of school culture, by level of challenging school circumstances. The data also revealed that in schools facing less challenging circumstances, principals' passive behaviours were related to students' achievements and principals' perceived effectiveness, but not in schools facing more challenging circumstances. The findings and their implications are discussed. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - When preparing TPACK ready teacher candidates, faculty must incorporate and model TPACK within the teacher education curriculum, which often requires an ongoing change process. But for change to take place we must consider the role leadership plays in the innovation of change. Leaders, deans and department heads must be an integral part of this process. The challenge for innovation, change and education technology leaders is to transform teacher preparation programs into fully realized TPACK environments and determine the necessary learning opportunities and support necessary to motivate college leaders and faculty to fully embrace the change process. This article outlines a collaborative ongoing process and blueprint that leaders should consider as they make plans for the effective integration of TPACK into their colleges. "Tomorrow's teachers must be prepared to rethink, unlearn and relearn, change, revise, and adapt" (Niess, 2008, p.225). Leaders, deans and department heads must be an integral part of this process if it is to be successful.While technology can support changes in how teacher educators teach and future teachers learn to teach (Dilworth et al., 2012), teaching with technology is a "wicked problem" in that it has "incomplete, contradictory and changing requirements" (Koehler & Mishra, 2008, p.10). New and innovative ways of confronting this complexity must address core knowledge base components that include content, pedagogy, and technology. These components have been used as the foundation for a technology,pedagogy, andcontent knowledge(TPACK) framework known as technological pedagogical content knowledge, or TPCK (AACTE, 2008; Koehler & Mishra, 2008; Mishra & Koehler, 2006; Pierson, 1999). But what is the role of leaders where TPACK based processes are being implemented in university teacher preparation programs?Educational technology leaders often approach models for teacher preparation in collectives that examine them iteratively. The 2012 National Technology Leadership Summit brought together the American Association of Colleges for Teacher Education (AACTE) and its Innovation and Technology Committee. Representatives from college administrations met and examined leadership issues facing deans, directors and chairs as they work to support college-wide change facilitating faculty and teacher candidates in the task of becoming TPACK proficient. This work built upon a CITE (Contemporary Issues in Technology and Teacher Education) journal editorial focused on initial conversations around leadership needs for effective TPACK implementation (Dexter, Herring, & Thomas, 2012). A presentation at AACTE 2013 extended this work with teacher preparation and education technology leaders sharing "what worked" in their colleges around these processes. A panel presentation at the 2013 Society for Information Technology and Teacher Education (SITE) Conference also shared insights into a blueprint for key areas that leaders should consider as they make plans for the effective integration of TPACK into their colleges as well as several implementation case studies. This article compiles this iterative work from a leadership perspective.While the challenge is to transform teacher preparation programs into fully realized TPACK environments, leadership becomes the key in developing new ways of confronting this complex issue that must address core knowledge base components inclusive of content, pedagogy and technology. To accomplish this task, faculty are faced with incorporating modeling these ideas within a teacher education curriculum in concert with ongoing change processes. A solid understanding of the interactions of these components can result in effective teaching with technology in varied and diverse settings; but the critical role of leadership in making such changes must first be considered.The critical features of a blueprint for leaders is based upon the work of Leithwood and colleagues' framework comprised of three key leadership functions associated with improved student outcomes (Day, Sammons, Leithwood, Kington, 2008; Leithwood, Harris & Hopkins, 2008; Leithwood & Jantzi, 2008; Leithwood & Riehl, 2003). The three major component of the Leithwood transformational leadership model are: (1) Building vision and setting direction (2) Developing people through understanding people and (3) Developing the organization through redesigning it.Leithwood, Begley and Cousins (1994) define transformational leadership as follows:The term 'transform' implies major changes in the form, nature, function and/or potential of some phenomenon; applied to leadership, it specifies general ends to be pursued although it is largely mute with respect to means. From this beginning, we consider the central purpose of transformational leadership to be the enhancement of the individual and collective problem-solving capacities of organizational members; such capacities are exercised in the identification of goals to be achieved and practices to be used in their achievement (p. 7).Transformational leaders can create significant change in both followers and the organization with which they are associated (Griffin, 2003). Transformational leaders also find common ground that allows them to enlist followers in processes of change. Fullan (2010) finds that for true reform to take place, resolute leadership that remains focused is critical when new ideas encounter serious difficulty, thereby sustaining and building on success.To achieve this task and create significant change, transformational education leaders realize that true technology integration means understanding and negotiating the relationships between the three components of knowledge and going beyond a "business" organizational model to create change in teacher preparation programs. Too often organizations start down the road to change without being clear on key factors that influence the outcomes of the initiative. Deans and educational leaders must develop a model for change based upon both the organizational culture and the environments they need a set of resources to help and guide them to integrate a framework like TPACK. Through ongoing collaboration and discussion the focus has been around the development of a leadership module which would help leaders establish a vision and set a direction for addressing TPACK. The purpose of a leadership module would be to provide Deans and other educational leaders with the tools they need for full-scale implementation and motivate them to redesign their programs while continuing to improve and sustain a developing / changing curriculum. © 2013 Association for Educational Communications and Technology.

AB  - Currently, the university failure rate is around 33% of students starting their studies. Among the main reasons are demanding academic situations and the use of inappropriate coping strategies. Therefore, the aim of this study was to analyze the influence of teacher leadership on academic resilience and motivation, burnout, and academic performance. This study involved 3354 university students. A structural equation model was made to analyze the predictive relationships between the study’s variables. The results showed that teacher leadership positively predicted academic resilience and motivation; academic resilience negatively predicted burnout and positively predicted academic performance; likewise, academic motivation negatively predicted burnout and positively predicted academic performance; finally, burnout negatively predicted academic resilience. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Drawing from transformational leadership theory, this research examined adolescent perceptions of transformational teaching within school-based physical education. In Study 1, focus groups with 62 adolescents examined perceptions of physical education teachers' behaviors. In Study 2, follow-up semi-structured interviews were conducted with 18 purposively sampled students. Findings revealed that behaviors within physical education settings can be understood within a conceptual framework that includes transformational teaching. In addition, students who perceived their teachers to utilize transformational behaviors described more adaptive responses. Issues concerning theory development and the application of transformational teaching to physical activity and health promotion settings are considered. Copyright © 2010.

AB  - Purpose: Across K–12 settings, instructional coaching continues to flourish as an approach to teacher professional development intended to address long-standing inequities in student achievement. Yet, coaching models differ in how to conceptualize change or transformation as a result of coaching efforts. Design/methodology/approach: This case study problematizes the concept of change within one practice-based coaching program, by positing the possibilities of striving for transformational change directed at addressing educational inequities. Findings: Qualitative methods reveal how coaching belief statements guide the burgeoning identities of beginning coaches to align to (and at times extend beyond) coaching for change through the lens of teacher practice. Practical implications: Implications describe ways that coaching programs might utilize reflection and analysis activities to foster more equity-oriented coaching identities, regardless of coaching model. Originality/value: Designing and facilitating authentic learning opportunities for coaches to reflect, rehearse, connect, and apply knowledge to practice as they develop their own understanding of what it means to coach for change is crucial. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Transformational leadership theory was examined in 89 schools in Singapore using a split sample technique (N = 846 teachers). The study sought to examine the influence of transformational leader behavior by school principals as it related to organizational commitment, organizational citizenship behavior, teacher satisfaction with leader, and student academic performance. Attitudinal and behavioral data were collected from both teachers and principals; student academic performance was collected from school records. School level analyses showed that transformational leadership had significant add‐on effects to transactional leadership in the prediction of organizational commitment, organizational citizenship behavior, and teacher satisfaction. Moreover, transformational leadership was found to have indirect effects on student academic achievement. Finally, it was found that transactional leadership had little add‐on effect on transformational leadership in predicting outcomes. Implications and directions for future research are discussed.

AB  - In higher education, student evaluation of teaching is widely used as a measure of an academic's teaching performance despite considerable disagreement as to its value. This paper begins by examining the merit of teaching evaluations with reference to the factors influencing the accuracy of the teaching evaluation process. One of the central assumptions on which student evaluation of teaching is based is that there is a relationship between student achievement and student rating of teachers. However, the findings of the majority of studies do not support this assumption. The absence of a strong link between student achievement and teaching evaluations suggests that there is scope for examining other approaches to measuring effective classroom dynamics. This paper presents such an approach based on the notion of transformational classroom leadership. © 2008 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - A widely accepted new leadership approach concerns transactional and transformational leadership. Transactional leadership consists of planning, implementation, and evaluation. Transformational leadership consists of charisma, intellectual stimulation, and individualized consideration that can motivate followers. The six orientations that characterize the Catholic healthcare ministry imply both types of leadership. Fundamental values, knowledge, and skills required for healthcare organization management are acquired through health administration education. The themes prevalent in today's Catholic healthcare ministry and the leadership qualities they imply are addressed by all aspects of such education: degree programs, field experience, continuing education, and research and consultation. Much of a master's degree program concentrates on transactional leadership because its content is better formulated and easier to teach. The development of transformational leadership qualities during master's study primarily provides a foundation on which students can build. Health administration programs in cooperation with healthcare organizations have created three models for field experience: internships, residencies, and fellowships. Many master's programs deliver continuing education programs for both types of leadership, and research and consultation contribute to this education.

AB  - In the present study, the direct effect of principal transformational leadership to school staff turnover and school performance was examined, in addition to its indirect effect through school staff job satisfaction. Survey data were obtained from elementary school staff and students, and school-aggregated student achievement test scores were obtained from school archives. Results showed that staff reports of principal behaviors could be described in terms of the three components of transformational leadership: inspiration or charisma, individualized consideration, and intellectual stimulation. Principal transformational leadership was not associated directly with either school staff turnover or school-aggregated student achievement progress. Rather, principal transformational leadership showed an indirect effect, through staff job satisfaction, on school staff turnover (negative) and on school-aggregated student achievement progress (positive). Finally, higher levels of school staff job satisfaction were associated with smaller achievement gaps between minority and non-minority students. This result was more evident among schools having higher levels of principal transformational leadership. Results are discussed in relation to the role of transformational leadership in school performance and in recruiting, training, and evaluating school principals. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this article is to detail the results of a large survey based research project which sough to examine the relationships among leadership, organizational learning and teacher and student outcomes. Design A large survey based on questionnaires developed from non-school organizations was used to develop a model to test the nature and strength of the relationships between variables and to understand the interactive nature of leadership and organizational learning and their effects on student outcomes. Model testing employed a latent variables partial least squares path analysis procedure. Findings The results of research have shown that leadership characteristics of a school are important factors in promoting systems and structures that enable the school to be effective and improve, in brief, to operate as a learning organization. School leaders need to be skilled in transformational leadership practices which work, directly and indirectly through others, towards bringing about: consensus in the organization’s mission; structures for shared decision making; continual learning through reflective practice; high standards of professionalism; and, a supportive and appreciative climate that promotes a culture of trust and collaboration. The LOLSO research also demonstrates that schools can be identified as learning organizations as they establish sequentially systems and structures of operation that promote: a collaborative and trusting work environment; a shared and monitored mission; empowerment of its members to share decision-making, show initiative and take risks; and, on-going challenging and relevant professional development. These school factors of leadership and organizational learning are shown to influence what happens in the core business of the school; the teaching and learning. Value The article answers two fundamental questions: Does the nature of the leadership and the level of organizational learning in schools contribute to school effectiveness and improvement in terms of the extent of students’ participation in school, student academic self-concept and engagement with school? What is the nature of the relationship between non-academic student measures of participation in school, student self-concept and engagement with school and measures of student retention and academic achievement?. © 2010 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this study was to examine the relative impact of different types of leadership on students' academic and nonacademic outcomes. Research Design: The methodology involved an analysis of findings from 27 published studies of the relationship between leadership and student outcomes. The first meta-analysis, including 22 of the 27 studies, involved a comparison of the effects of transformational and instructional leadership on student outcomes. The second meta-analysis involved a comparison of the effects of five inductively derived sets of leadership practices on student outcomes. Twelve of the studies contributed to this second analysis. Findings: The first meta-analysis indicated that the average effect of instructional leadership on student outcomes was three to four times that of transformational leadership. Inspection of the survey items used to measure school leadership revealed five sets of leadership practices or dimensions: establishing goals and expectations; resourcing strategically; planning, coordinating, and evaluating teaching and the curriculum; promoting and participating in teacher learning and development, and ensuring an orderly and supportive environment. The second meta-analysis revealed strong average effects for the leadership dimension involving promoting and participating in teacher learning and development and moderate effects for the dimensions concerned with goal setting and planning, coordinating, and evaluating teaching and the curriculum. Conclusions and Implications for Research and Practice: The comparisons between transformational and instructional leadership and between the five leadership dimensions suggested that the more leaders focus their relationships, their work, and their learning on the core business of teaching and learning, the greater their influence on student outcomes. The article concludes with a discussion of the need for leadership research and practice to be more closely linked to the evidence on effective teaching and effective teacher learning. Such alignment could increase the impact of school leadership on student outcomes even further. © 2008 The University Council for Educational Administration.

AB  - Using data from a larger 4-year evaluation of England's National Literacy and Numeracy Strategies, this study tested the effects of a school-specific model of transformational leadership on teachers (motivation, capacities, and work settings), their classroom practices, and gains in student achievement. Some 2,290 teachers from 655 primary schools responded to 2 forms of a survey (literacy and numeracy) measuring all variables in our framework. Our measure of student achievement was gains in the British government's own Key Stage 2 tests over either 2 (numeracy) or 3 (literacy) years. Path analytic techniques were used to analyze the several different versions of the results. Results indicate significant effects of leadership on teachers' classroom practices but not on student achievement.

AB  - Teachers are in a very real sense the embodiment of leadership, providing direction, guidance, and feedback to their students in addition to acting as role models. Teachers may well thus benefit from developmental coaching that draws on theories of leadership. This study was both an experimental (randomly assigned conditions) and a quasi-experimental (pre-post) study. A randomized controlled design was used to explore the impact of coaching on goal attainment, mental health, workplace well-being, and resilience, and a quasi-experimental (pre-post) design was used to explore the impact of coaching on leadership styles. Forty-four high school teachers were randomly assigned to either coaching or a waitlist control group. The coaching used a cognitive-behavioral, solution-focused approach and was informed by theories of self-leadership and transformational leadership. Participants in the coaching group received multirater feedback on their leadership style and undertook 10 coaching sessions conducted by professional coaches over a 20-week period. Compared with randomly allocated controls, participation in coaching was associated with increased goal attainment, reduced stress, and enhanced workplace well-being and resilience. Pre-post analyses for the coaching group indicated that coaching enhanced self-reported achievement and humanistic-encouraging components of constructive leadership styles and reduced self-reported aggressive/defensive and passive/defensive leadership styles. Findings suggest that coaching, as a professional development methodology, has great potential to contribute to the development and well-being of society beyond the corporate and organizational settings with which leadership coaching and executive coaching are normally associated. © 2010 American Psychological Association.

AB  - Researchers have suggested that transformational leadership is an important aspect of effective schools; however; whether the effects vary across related studies and the robustness of the overall effect size remain unclear. A meta-analysis technique was used to synthesize the results of 28 independent studies and to investigate the overall relationship between transformational school leadership and three measures of school outcomes. The study found that, in terms of the mean effect sizes, transformational school leadership does have positive effects on teacher job satisfaction, school effectiveness perceived by teachers, and student achievement.

AB  - Purpose: Most studies on the impact of school culture focus only on teachers' average perceptions and neglect the possibility that a meaningful increment to the prediction of school effectiveness might be provided by the variance in teachers' culture perceptions. The objectives of this article are to (a) better understand how teachers' collective decision making and principal's leadership are related to the schools' culture homogeneity and (b) test the moderating role of the schools' culture homogeneity on the relationship between four cultural scales and the schools' mathematics achievement. Method: The sample of this study consisted of 2,595 students nested in 52 schools and 125 classes from the French-speaking community of Belgium. Students performed two mathematics achievement tests and answered a self-reported questionnaire on their backgrounds. All the teachers (n = 817) of the 52 schools answered a self-reported questionnaire dealing with the principal's leadership, school culture, and teacher collegiality. Hypotheses are tested using correlation, regression, and hierarchical regression analyses. Research Findings: First, it was found that culture homogeneity is positively associated with (a) the principal's transformational leadership (TL) and (b) the teachers' collective decision making relative to pedagogical aspects. Second, it was shown that the impact of TL on culture homogeneity is partially mediated by teachers' collective decision making. Third, the analyses found no moderation effect of culture homogeneity on the relationship between cultural values and students' achievement but did show partial evidence of such an effect in specific groups of schools (with low or high socioeconomic status composition). Implications: This study provides a deeper understanding of how social arrangements and leadership processes within schools contribute to the emergence of collective cultural values. But the results also shed light on the weak associations between cultural values and student achievement, even when considering an appropriate definition and conceptualization of the school culture. © 2009 The University Council for Educational Administration.

AB  - Purpose - This paper aims to detail the human resource management practices that have helped Majan College, Oman, to win a string of prizes for total quality management. Design/methodology/approach - The paper outlines the characteristics of four main leadership styles - transformational, authoritarian, participative and delegative - and describes the benefits the college has gained by, in the main, practicing transformational leadership. Findings - The paper shows that, when transformational leadership is practiced, team members believe that their leaders care about them as people, rather than as a means to an end; leaders pay close attention to team members' need for achievement and personal growth, creating an environment in which team members feel that they are pursuing meaningful goals; and leaders gain credibility and respect by "walking the talk". Practical implications - The paper provides useful information on the advantages and disadvantages of various leadership styles, when practiced in an academic environment. Originality/value - The paper reveals that other leadership styles also have their part to play. In particular, authoritarian leadership can help when there is an urgent need to: ensure tasks are completed on time and within the financial budget; meet accreditation and quality requirements; and meet student needs. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - Focusing on school leadership relations between principals and teachers, this study examines the potential of their active collaboration around instructional matters to enhance the quality of teaching and student performance. The analysis is grounded in two conceptions of leadership- transformational and instructional. The sample comprises 24 nationally selected restructured schools - 8 elementary, 8 middle, and 8 high schools. In keeping with the multilevel structure of the data, the primary analytic technique is hierarchical linear modeling (HLM). The study finds that transformational leadership is a necessary but insufficient condition for instructional leadership. When transformational and shared instructional leadership coexist in an integrated form of leadership, the influence on school performance, measured by the quality of its pedagogy and the achievement of its students, is substantial.

AB  - Collaborative school cultures have been associated with the achievement of a number of school reform objectives for both teachers and students. Little is known, however, about how such cultures develop and whether or how school administrators can facilitate that process. This study examined the practices of administrators in each of 12 schools which had developed highly collaborative professional relationships over a three year period in the context of school improvement initiatives. Results suggest the feasibility of developing more collaborative school cultures in a relatively brief period of time and clarify the role played by the larger context of school improvement for fostering collaboration. Specific strategies used by the administrators are described. These strategies are associated with a concept of leadership termed “transformational”. © 1990, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - This qualitative case study of an exceptional school in the south of England challenges the hypothesis that transformational leaders significantly impact on student outcomes. Interviews with staff and students, together with classroom observation, confirm that the head, appointed in 1995, has played an important role in transforming internal processes and in changing the context of the school. Although the observed and reported behaviour of leaders, teachers, and students matches expectations from the literature, the consequences for student achievement are unclear. Background variables seem to explain most of the apparent improvement in student outcomes. An effectiveness framework that assigns disproportionate value to examination results seems to have created a leadership paradox, where heads reported to be transformational produce only limited gains in performance. The study concludes that the government's determination to assume a strongly positive relationship between leaders and outcomes has compromised the principle of evidence-informed policy-making and that we need a different approach based on a broadly defined, qualitative conception of student success.

AB  - Supervision as a field, in the main, remains susceptible and thus vulnerable to various forces, ideological and otherwise, that constrain its ability to play a significant role in instructional improvement and thus in educational leadership. Adherence to inspectional and faultfinding supervision under the guise of standards-based and other practices has serious consequences for the improvement of teaching and student achievement. Unless those of us who are committed to the study of supervision in higher education, as well as school administrators and other practitioners who supervise teachers, are ready, willing and able to assert responsibilities for best practice in supervision through transformational leadership the educational landscape will remain in its transitory and vulnerable state, inconsequential at best, destructive at worst. Relying on the social and educational critiques of Robert Goldhammer and Jules Henry, this article seeks to raise the consciousness of those committed to instructional excellence by offering insights into ways supervision can serve to enhance teachers' dignity, impact student learning and transform our work, and even schools themselves, so that vulnerability turns into possibilities and stagnation into transformation.

AB  - Principals are held accountable for student achievement although most studies find that they have no direct effect on it. In this study we tested a model hypothesizing that principals contribute to student achievement indirectly through teacher commitment and beliefs about their collective capacity. Path analysis of data from 205 elementary schools supported this hypothesis. Schools with higher levels of transformational leadership had higher collective teacher efficacy, greater teacher commitment to school mission, school community, and school-community partnerships, and higher student achievement. Increasing the transformational leadership practices in schools makes a small but practically important contribution to overall student achievement.
