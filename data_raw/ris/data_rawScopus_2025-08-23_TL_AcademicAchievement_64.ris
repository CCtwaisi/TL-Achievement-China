AB  - This article explored the different clusters of leadership styles and the relationship between principal leadership style and student academic achievement in domains of mathematics, reading, science, and collaborative problem-solving in Germany and China. We used PISA 2015 data covering 6,504 students and 256 school principals from German schools and 9,841 students and 268 school leaders from Chinese schools. Results identified three leadership styles in Germany, namely, transformational (23.4%), instructional (41.3%), and integrated (35.3%) leadership, and two leadership styles in China, namely, transformational (38.6%) and instructional (61.4%) principals. Principals with instructional and integrated leadership had higher student achievements in Germany, whereas only principals with transformational leadership had slightly higher student achievements in China. Moreover, three leadership styles in Germany and two in China showed their relationships with each domain of student achievement. In conclusion, principals in Germany and China had different priorities in leading schools. The differences that principal leadership made on student achievements highlighted the differences in principals’ situational context and leading characteristics between Germany and China. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - As key members of the executive team, nurse executives play an integral role in the planning process and operationalization of strategic imperatives to ensure the overall success of the organization. Nurse executives are leading organizations through transition periods that require transformational leadership. Leaders must design a shared vision and set strategic priorities; empower others to lead; ensure access to resources needed for safe care delivery; and inspire people to meet the demands of the future. Paramount to effective strategic planning and achievement of positive outcomes is a leadership team that engages key stakeholders in the strategic planning process. This article provides an overview of a recently integrated health system's strategic planning process that included the engagement of patients and caregivers. This can serve as a blueprint for others in their efforts to implement a systematic approach for enhancing collaborative academic practice in their organizations. © 2019 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

AB  - This study explores the unique potential of gifted sixth graders in Abu Dhabi, focusing on enhancing their verbal-linguistic intelligence and leadership skills through targeted educational interventions. Recognizing the critical need for specialized programs to support gifted students, this research employs a quasi-experimental design to evaluate the effectiveness of the Integrated Curriculum Model (ICM). Participants included sixth-grade students from two groups: an experimental group receiving the ICM intervention and a control group following the standard curriculum. We collected data using structured questionnaires and analyzed the results using mean, standard deviation, and t-tests to determine statistically significant differences between the groups. Findings revealed that the experimental group showed significantly higher improvements in both verbal-linguistic intelligence and leadership skills compared to the control group, with a significance level of.05. These results underscore the importance of tailored educational strategies in unlocking the full potential of gifted students. The study’s theoretical implications highlight the applicability of Gardner’s Theory of Multiple Intelligences and Burns’ Transformational Leadership Theory in educational settings. Practically, the findings provide valuable insights for educators, policymakers, and parents on the benefits of specialized programs for gifted students, suggesting that such interventions can also positively impact typically developing children. Future research should continue to explore and refine these educational strategies to further support the development of gifted students. © 2025 Common Ground Research Networks. All rights reserved.

AB  - School leadership has been identified as a key function in assuring quality in education. The instructional leadership model refers to the role and the functions of school leadership to employ different management tasks with regards to teaching and learning. Instructional leadership role includes (a) developing mission and goals, (b) managing the educational production function, (c) promoting an academic learning climate, and (d) developing a supportive work environment. Instructional leaders were described as leading from a combination of both expertise and charisma focused primarily on the improvement of student learning outcomes. The monograph, entitled Instructional Leadership and Effective Teaching and Learning and written by Nazmi Xhomara, is dedicated to school instructional leadership as an important factor that influences teaching and learning at school. In the first chapter, the author presents and analyzes educational leadership vs educational management, as well as models of educational leadership and management. The author argues on the importance of different leadership models, such as managerial leadership, transformational leadership, participative leadership, interpersonal leadership, transactional leadership, postmodern leadership, moral leadership, and contingent leadership. Chapters Two, Three, and Four shed light on instructional leadership and teaching and learning, understanding of instructional leadership, the concept and practice of instructional leadership, instructional school leadership and learning environment, attributes of instructional leaders, instructional excellence, instructional leadership time management, effective teaching and teachers, as well as teaching challenges and learning environment. Meanwhile, the author has analyzed constructivism, student intelligence, understanding of supervision, instructional collegial supervision, supervision approaches, understanding of evaluation of teaching and learning, teacher evaluation, and instructional observing instruments in chapters Five, Six, and Seven. Chapters Eight and Nine are focused especially on the research work of the relationships between instructional leadership and teaching, learning, and students' achievements, as well as on an empirical study designed and conducted in Albania as a case. Chapters Ten and Eleven are dedicated to instructional leadership preparation and the future of instructional leadership. As a conclusion, Xhomara indicates that principals are responsible for developing school climates and cultures that support the very best instructional practices. The new era of instructional leadership has predictably placed significant demands for accountability for student success and equity on the principal as well as for the university programs that prepare them. Working in twenty-first-century schools, the instructional leader is held more accountable than ever for student success. © 2021 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Educational institutions across the nation are being unsuccessful at meeting academic goals set by the states and preparing students to be college and career ready. Many schools around the globe are suffering from a shortage of experienced and competent school leaders that can bring about positive change and increase student achievement. Thus, the objective of this study was to determine the correlation between leadership practices, school culture, and student achievement in an effort to build the capacity of principal leaders. A correlational design was used to determine the relationship between principal leadership practices, culture, and achievement in elementary, middle, and high schools. A total of 216 teachers in 31 schools completed the Leadership Practices Inventory and School Culture Survey. A significant correlation was found between (a) leadership practices and school culture and (b) school culture and student achievement. No relationship was established between leadership practices and school culture. The results implied that school leaders who use transformational leadership practices indirectly impact student achievement through creating a positive school culture. It is recommended that principal preparation programs revamp leadership curriculum to develop leaders who can create positive school cultures and manage reform efforts. © The Turkish Online Journal of Educational Technology.

AB  - In higher education, student evaluation of teaching is widely used as a measure of an academic's teaching performance despite considerable disagreement as to its value. This paper begins by examining the merit of teaching evaluations with reference to the factors influencing the accuracy of the teaching evaluation process. One of the central assumptions on which student evaluation of teaching is based is that there is a relationship between student achievement and student rating of teachers. However, the findings of the majority of studies do not support this assumption. The absence of a strong link between student achievement and teaching evaluations suggests that there is scope for examining other approaches to measuring effective classroom dynamics. This paper presents such an approach based on the notion of transformational classroom leadership. © 2008 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Learning occurs at all levels in school and leadership for learning is an integral part of the school and that for learning to happen, there must be trust, autonomy and high level of teacher professionalism with a strong professional learning community. This chapter synthesizes information from various studies of principal instructional leadership since its inception in the 1980s, its subjection to the various changes that happen in schools during the accountability era and school-based management period, as well as the rising and waning of various theories, to show how it is influenced leading to its evolution into 'leadership for learning' which is also known as 'leading learning'. The original model of instructional leadership is initially described and how the subsequent transformational leadership, distributed leadership, and teacher leadership are incorporated into the original instructional leadership theory to produce an integrated leadership for learning were also elaborated. This chapter re-visits the belief and importance placed on school leadership in addition to its crucial role in students' academic achievement and school improvement. Based on reviews of earlier leadership theories, more insights into leadership across different contexts and professional activities can illustrate some of the benefits of such an approach. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2023.

AB  - The relevance of school principals’ leadership behaviour in promoting school effectiveness and improvement is less discussed and known in emerging countries, explicitly in Sub-Saharan countries. Moreover, there is a significant inconclusive body of literature on the most dominant leadership model (instructional (IL) and transformational (TL) in determining the coherence of school improvement and student academic achievement. Hence, the current study extended the knowledge by examining the impact of IL and TL on implementing the School Improvement Programme (SIP) in the Ethiopian context designed to foster students’ academic performance. This study randomly sampled and surveyed 2880 public secondary school teachers and 70 principals. The study’s findings suggested that school principals’ personal information, gender, academic qualification, and leadership experience determine their leadership style, the coherence of SIP, and school performance. Unlike previous evidence, this study’s findings shed light on the principals’ IL and TL practice, which significantly impacted students’ academic achievement through the mediating role of coherent SIP. © 2025 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this article is to detail the results of a large survey based research project which sough to examine the relationships among leadership, organizational learning and teacher and student outcomes. Design A large survey based on questionnaires developed from non-school organizations was used to develop a model to test the nature and strength of the relationships between variables and to understand the interactive nature of leadership and organizational learning and their effects on student outcomes. Model testing employed a latent variables partial least squares path analysis procedure. Findings The results of research have shown that leadership characteristics of a school are important factors in promoting systems and structures that enable the school to be effective and improve, in brief, to operate as a learning organization. School leaders need to be skilled in transformational leadership practices which work, directly and indirectly through others, towards bringing about: consensus in the organization’s mission; structures for shared decision making; continual learning through reflective practice; high standards of professionalism; and, a supportive and appreciative climate that promotes a culture of trust and collaboration. The LOLSO research also demonstrates that schools can be identified as learning organizations as they establish sequentially systems and structures of operation that promote: a collaborative and trusting work environment; a shared and monitored mission; empowerment of its members to share decision-making, show initiative and take risks; and, on-going challenging and relevant professional development. These school factors of leadership and organizational learning are shown to influence what happens in the core business of the school; the teaching and learning. Value The article answers two fundamental questions: Does the nature of the leadership and the level of organizational learning in schools contribute to school effectiveness and improvement in terms of the extent of students’ participation in school, student academic self-concept and engagement with school? What is the nature of the relationship between non-academic student measures of participation in school, student self-concept and engagement with school and measures of student retention and academic achievement?. © 2010 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

AB  - 1. Background Systematic reviews may inform public policies and contribute to the building of a knowledge base. However, reviews of school leadership research are relatively rare in Taiwan. This study conducted a bibliometric review to analyze journal papers by Taiwanese scholars in the Scopus database published in the previous 20 years. The focus was to examine the connection between Taiwanese and global research on school leadership. 2. Research questions On the basis of the research background, four research questions were proposed: (1) What is the volume and growth trajectory of Taiwanese school leadership research?(2) What is the international visibility of Taiwanese school leadership research as revealed through citation analysis? (3) What are the main topics covered by Taiwanese school leadership research and how do they correspond to the global trend? (4) What is the intellectual structure of Taiwanese school leadership research and how do it connect with the global literature? 3. Theoretical framework (1) Intellectual development of school leadership research The theory movement in the 1950s and 1960s highlighted the development of educational administration research. Griffiths (1959) categorized these theories into four groups: social system and role theory, leadership theory, decision theory, and organizational theory. In the 1970s,contingency theory, which emphasizes the influence of context on leadership, was proposed. With the growing interest in school effectiveness and school reform, the organizational perspective was applied to investigate school leadership. Instructional leadership was also emphasized from then on. In the 1990s, other leadership approaches such as transformational leadership, moral leadership, and distributed leadership became popular in school leadership research. With the power paradigm shifting from a heroic view of leaders to a more dispersed view of power, distributed leadership and teacher leadership were also highly recognized. In response to the international context, leadership for learning, which includes elements of instructional leadership, transformational leadership, and shared leadership, has gained global attention in the new millennium. (2) Retrospective view of school leadership research Systematic reviews did not appear in the field of educational administration until the 1980s. EPPI-Centre (2012) indicated the four key features of systematic reviews. First, a high quality systematic review is explicit and is conducted using transparent methods. Second, it follows a standard set of stages. Third, the review is accountable, replicable, and updateable. Fourth, users should be involved to ensure reports are relevant and useful. The elements of reviews include the central topics of interest, guiding questions, and goals; a conceptual perspective for guiding there view’s selection, evaluation, and interpretation of the studies; sources and types of data; data evaluation and analysis; and the major results of the review (Hallinger, 2014). However, according to Hallinger’s study in 2014, only eight reviews met these criteria. Of the eight studies, some used critical synthesis, some adopted meta-analysis, and some employed both. In recent years, network analysis, data mining, and bibliometric analysis are increasingly being applied in systematic reviews. In addition to a greater diversity in methods, the regions under review have expanded from the United States and United Kingdom to many other regions. This development can be attributed to Hallinger’s effort to initiate international collaboration to build the knowledge base of educational leadership in Asia. Because of the growing interest in the academic development in non-Western countries, he promoted the use of systematic reviews to examine studies in Asia, Africa, Saudi Arabia, and Central and South America, which resulted in more than 30 systematic reviews on educational leadership and management. A wide range of research topics is a prominent feature of educational leadership and management research. Five topics that have gained frequent attention are social justice, female leadership, school leadership preparation and development, trust, and instruction and instructional leadership. The following are the topics of frontier research in this field: principal, school leadership, and student achievement; distributed leadership, instructional leadership, teacher learning, accountability, school improvement, school reform, and leadership development; and race, justice, and urban education. In Taiwan, research reviews on educational leadership are scant. According to Lin’s (2000) review, only a few studies have focused on the impact of principals on students. Pan’s (2010) review indicated that of all the educational leadership studies in government-funded projects and journals,70% of the topics were related to principals’ leadership styles and behaviors. The distribution of the research topics was not sufficiently diversified to reflect global academic development. 4. Research method This study used bibliometric analysis on the Scopus database to analyze Taiwanese school leadership research. The review process was based on the steps of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) developed by Moher et al. (2009). After the process of screening, identification, eligibility determination, and inclusion, 95 papers were included for analysis. Descriptive analysis, citation analysis, co-occurrence analysis of keywords, and co-citation analysis were conducted to address the research questions. 5. Research findings The study had the following three key findings: (1) Concerning the volume of publication in journals, the first English paper on Taiwanese school leadership research did not appear until 2001.Although the promotion of the world university rankings and the launch of the Top University Project have changed the trend of solely using Chinese for academic writing, the number of English studies on school leadership remains limited. Moreover, only 14.7% of papers are published in the core journals of education leadership and management. (2) A citation analysis revealed that the international visibility of Taiwanese school leadership research is low. The average number of papers of the 10 most cited Taiwanese scholars is 3.5, and they have been cited an average of 45.2times. The number of citations of Taiwanese scholars is 3.33 times less than that of African educational leadership research and 11.78 times less than that of research on three emerging regions. (3) The research topics selected by Taiwanese scholars may highlight international academic development; however, some underdeveloped topics remain such as social justice leadership, organizational theory, institutional theory, and social capital. The current co-citation analysis revealed the four schools of thought of Taiwanese school leadership, namely leadership for learning, distributed forms of leadership, leadership behavior and its impact, and social network. 6. Contributions Systematic reviews on school leadership are scarce in Taiwan. The present study conducted a 206 bibliometric analysis to examine the development and features of Taiwanese school leadership literature which is innovative in the research method. The connection between Taiwanese studies on school leadership research and global scholarship has seldom been addressed in relevant research. The current analysis presents the development of Taiwanese school leadership and its connection with global trends, providing critical insights and directions for future research on school leadership in Taiwan. 7. Implications The present findings indicate the future direction of Taiwanese academic development in the field of educational administration. First, publishing more research in English can help increase the international impact of Taiwanese scholars. Greater exposure in English publications can highlight the fruitful outcome of Taiwanese school leadership research internationally. Building the academic connections between Taiwan and other countries will also be beneficial. Second, the current study identified a gap between Taiwanese school leadership research and the global trend. Including more diversified topics may help broaden the scope of research. Some topics recommended for future study include social justice leadership, organizational theory, institutional theory, social capital theory, social justice theory, and critical racialism. Third, conducting periodic replication studies using bibliometric analysis may help track the development of Taiwanese school leadership research. In particular, this method allows for a comparison of the distinguishing features of research among different periods. Fourth, a bibliometric analysis on Taiwanese school leadership research published in Chinese would be of considerable value. Taiwan has several literature databases that collect domestic research. However, the data structure provides insufficient information for an effective bibliometric analysis. To maximize the usefulness of these databases, their data structure design merits special consideration. © 2021, National Taiwan Normal University. All rights reserved.

AB  - Servitization in the manufacturing industry implies a shift from an offer based mainly on standard goods, to a wider value proposition composed of solutions aimed at solving specific customers’ problems, obtained by integrating tangible and intangible elements. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the servitization strategies of manufacturing firms, more specifically about: (i) how manufacturing companies move toward servitization (servitization pattern); (ii) how they achieve the capabilities needed; and (iii) which factors enable this transition. We did so by comparing the state of the art of academic research with a qualified sample of case studies of global companies that famously improved their competitiveness by shifting from products to solutions. The results show some gaps between research and practice, concerning in particular: the impact (either transformational or integrative) of servitization on the manufacturing organization; the role of financial resources in shaping the capability achievement strategy, particularly for external acquisitions, and; the role of servitization enablers poorly considered by the extant literature, such as time, leadership and continuity, operational excellence and digital technologies. These findings lead to the definition of seven formalized research directions, thus outlining an agenda for future research. © 2017 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - For effective technology leadership and for a comprehensive and appropriate use of technology in educational institutions, the standards essential for the heads of the institutions are: leadership and vision; learning and teaching; productivity and professional practice; support, management, and operations; assessment and evaluation; understanding of social, legal, and ethical issues related to technology; and interpersonal and communication skills. Information and Communication Technology (ICT) leadership supports effective instructional practices through a combination of interpersonal skills, knowledge of a variety of current technology applications, and the vision to anticipate future technology-based solutions for education. The potential benefits of good ICT leadership can include improved academic achievement by students, improved student attendance and reduced attrition, better vocational preparation of students, more efficient administrative operations, and reduced teacher/staff burnout and turnover. The main objectives of this study are to investigate principals’ ICT leadership practices in their respective colleges and the methods and strategies principals use to lead technology integration into the educational environment. Qualitative as well as quantitative data were collected by means of semi-structured interviews and questionnaires that were administered to teachers and principals of professional colleges. This study reveals that technology integration as an instructional strategy needs to be learned in the wider context of changing pedagogy and paradigms of thought about technology use in education. Principals who effectively lead ICT integration within their colleges classically perform well in leadership and management, vision and goal setting, student learning, teaching, professional development and training, operations and infrastructure support, and assessment and evaluation. © Springer India 2014.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine the relative impact of different types of leadership on students’ academic and nonacademic outcomes. The methodology involved an analysis of findings from 27 published studies of the relationship between leadership and student outcomes. The first meta-analysis, including 22 of the 7 studies, involved a comparison of the effects of transformational and instructional leadership on student outcomes. The second meta-analysis involved a comparison of the effects of five inductively derived sets of leadership practices on student outcomes. Twelve of the studies contributed to this second analysis. The first meta-analysis indicated that the average effect of instructional leadership on student outcomes was three to four times that of transformational leadership. Inspection of the survey items used to measure school leadership revealed five sets of leadership practices or dimensions: establishing goals and expectations; resourcing strategically; planning, coordinating, and evaluating teaching and the curriculum; promoting and participating in teacher learning and development, and ensuring an orderly and supportive environment. The second meta-analysis revealed strong average effects for the leadership dimension involving promoting and participating in teacher learning and development and moderate effects for the dimensions concerned with goal setting and planning, coordinating, and evaluating teaching and the curriculum. The comparisons between transformational and instructional leadership and between the five leadership dimensions suggested that the more leaders focus their relationships, their work, and their learning on the core business of teaching and learning, the greater their influence on student outcomes. The article concludes with a discussion of the need for leadership research and practice to be more closely linked to the evidence on effective teaching and effective teacher learning. Such alignment could increase the impact of school leadership on student outcomes even further. © 2014 Universidad Autonoma de Madrid. All rights reserved.

AB  - The study investigated whether students perceive their university instructors in a virtual learning environment as leaders. Referring to the full range leadership theory (FRLT), we examined the effects of transformational and passive leadership styles of university instructors on students' satisfaction and learning outcomes. Completed web-based questionnaires were obtained from 1270 students who enrolled in large academic courses led by instructors in web-based instructional environments. Data analyses confirmed the validity of the multifactor leadership questionnaire (MLQ) in the virtual asynchronous communication setting with three second-order factors model composed of transformational, active management-by-exception and passive leadership. Leadership styles correlated with student satisfaction: the more the students attributed transformational leadership style to the instructor and the less they attributed a passive leadership style, the more satisfied they were. The attributed leadership style was not related to the actual participation of the students in the virtual discussions or to their academic achievements. The findings suggest that subordinates' satisfaction might be tied more strongly to their perception of the leader than to the actual tangible benefits the leader can provide. Moreover, the study shows that the FRLT is applied to the asynchronous, web-based, instructional environment which is being increasingly adopted in higher education institutions. © The Author(s) 2013.

AB  - It is clear from the literature that there is no consensus on the most effective type of leadership behavior which promotes one of the main objectives of education, namely student achievement. This current study was initiated due to the prevalence of low student achievement as well as the observed controversies regarding effective types of leadership behaviors in secondary schools in the Gedeo Zone of Ethiopia. The aim of the study was to examine the effect of secondary school principals’ leadership behaviors on student outcomes in the zone and consequently to identify effective types of leadership constructs that could enhance learners’ success. An explanatory sequential mixed-design approach was used with a sample of six schools which were chosen by using a maximum variation strategy. Out of these six sampled schools, eighteen (18) participants, comprising of six (6) principals, four (4) district supervisors, two (2) zone education experts and six (6) PTSA chairmen were chosen for the qualitative phase. These participants were selected purposively as they have a better understanding, by virtue of their position regarding the effect of principals’ leadership behavior on student achievement. A close-ended questionnaire was used to collect quantitative data, while interviews and document analysis were used as research instruments in the qualitative phase. The findings of this study indicate that effective practicing of a combination of instructional and transformational leadership behaviors, in integrative ways, enhances student outcomes. ©Authors.

AB  - Purpose - This paper aims to detail the human resource management practices that have helped Majan College, Oman, to win a string of prizes for total quality management. Design/methodology/approach - The paper outlines the characteristics of four main leadership styles - transformational, authoritarian, participative and delegative - and describes the benefits the college has gained by, in the main, practicing transformational leadership. Findings - The paper shows that, when transformational leadership is practiced, team members believe that their leaders care about them as people, rather than as a means to an end; leaders pay close attention to team members' need for achievement and personal growth, creating an environment in which team members feel that they are pursuing meaningful goals; and leaders gain credibility and respect by "walking the talk". Practical implications - The paper provides useful information on the advantages and disadvantages of various leadership styles, when practiced in an academic environment. Originality/value - The paper reveals that other leadership styles also have their part to play. In particular, authoritarian leadership can help when there is an urgent need to: ensure tasks are completed on time and within the financial budget; meet accreditation and quality requirements; and meet student needs. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this study was to examine the ways principals in three high-needs middle schools enacted core leadership practices in concert with their immediate contexts to institutionalize comprehensive school reforms and support student learning. Research Methods: The schools were selected from a geographically stratified sample of public middle schools in a state in the southeastern United States. Multiple linear regression was used to identify schools performing better than expected considering their levels of poverty and other school-related factors. The final three schools, one from each geographic region, showed steady increases in academic achievement and school climate following the arrival of their principals. Data were primarily collected from interviews with principals, teaching and nonteaching staff, and parents using protocols adapted from the International Successful School Principalship Project. Findings: The findings explicate the large degree to which the leadership practices and beliefs that influenced student achievement in these schools were adapted to and commensurate with each school's immediate context. Furthermore, they illustrate how principals used these practices to institutionalize school-wide reform efforts as vehicles for leading change within their schools. Implications: The findings substantiate research on successful school leadership in high-needs middle schools. They also extend this research by examining the way core transformational and instructional leadership practices can be adapted to suit various school contexts and institutionalize school-wide reform efforts to enhance student learning. Further research is required to understand how principals decide to adapt their leadership practices, and how aspiring leaders can best learn to do so. © The University Council for Educational Administration 2013.

AB  - Purpose: An emphasis on school performance is not just a national issue, but must be examined within the global context. Successful leadership is ensured by school leaders’ compliance to a set of basic practices within particular school contexts. The impact of leadership styles on performance, the work environment and job satisfaction is emphasized, while the appropriate leadership style could make teachers more effective in terms of job productivity. The adoption of different leadership styles by school leaders shows positive results with regard to school effectiveness. The purpose of this paper is to describe school leadership styles and the influence the styles have on school performance. Design/methodology/approach: A quantitative approach with a post-positive paradigm was followed. A systematic random sample of 72 secondary schools in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, was selected. The Cronbach’s α coefficient, statistical significance (p-values) and effect size (d-values) were calculated, and a factor analysis was conducted. Findings: The results show a difference between teachers and principals regarding the transformational leadership style. The principals in the high-performing schools were perceived as less passive-avoidant in practice than those in the low-performing schools. A principal manages and leads a school effectively by applying an appropriate leadership style. Research limitations/implications: For future research, it will be advisable to make use of a mixed-method design. Although the Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire addressed numerous aspects of leadership and leadership styles, the “voice” of the respondents lacked. Furthermore, more leadership styles could be investigated in different contexts. Practical implications: A chosen principal leadership style is not necessarily the best style for this purpose. School principals and teachers interpret leadership styles differently. Communication is therefore important. Social implications: The principal leadership style is not always necessarily the teachers’ and learners’ choice. It is important that schools keep up with a constantly changing world. Originality/value: If school principals and teachers agree upon a specific leadership style, there may be better collaboration which enhances better academic performance as well as effectiveness regarding schools. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - This empirical research is about strengths-based leadership practices that seek to explore leadership for social justice and equity in New Zealand’s culturally and linguistically diverse educational and social landscape. Similar to the diversity in other countries, where leaders demonstrate culturally responsive leadership practices in their quest to educate diverse democracies. This inquiry examines the characteristics and behaviours of effective leadership for social justice and equity for student academic achievement in urban Auckland primary schools. A qualitative, comparative case study, combined with the theoretical framework of applied critical leadership from theories of transformational leadership, critical pedagogy and critical race theory (perspective lens) guided the research methods. The research findings presented several applied critical leadership characteristics that highlighted the complexities of leading for social justice in urban Auckland primary schools. A distinct phenomenon was leader’s axiological philosophy (values, beliefs and morals) underpinning their leadership that was culturally responsive to the diversity in their educational contexts. These findings suggest the need for research and scholarship yet to be done in this largely unexplored educational leadership academic space. © 2016 by the author; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Japan, known for its good healthcare access via universal health insurance, leads the world in terms of life expectancy, and possesses a public health system that has improved health standards markedly in the 20th century. However, we currently face major challenges to maintain and promote people's health. Although these complicated problems pose numerous threats to public welfare, education of public health for health professionals still retains 20th-century standards. This also means that graduate education of public health in Japan is traditionally based on obtaining licensure as a medical professional, conducting research and writing papers, and on-the-job training. Since graduate school education is expected to produce competent public health leaders, Japan requires a reform toward a new education design that caters to the current societal needs. The current global trend in the education of health professionals leans toward outcome-based education to meet core competencies. Here, "competency" refers to a set of features or particular behavioral patterns possessed by highly qualified persons. In 2006, the World Health Organization (WHO) established a general health professional competency standard that includes both management and leadership competencies. Moreover, the Lancet Commission concluded that there was a need for transformative education based on a "health system approach." In brief, this means that our education should correspond to the needs of the health system to allow for the resolution of problems by educated professionals with satisfactory levels of competencies. In addition, as "change agents," these competent professionals are expected to promote societal change toward the realization of better public health. In Japan, the Central Education Council has produced several reports on professional graduate school reform since 2000. These reports indicate that graduate school curricula require reform to allow the health professionals to work locally and globally, as well as to solve problems through the application of systematic knowledge that matches practice with theory. Therefore, with reference to the current Japanese health situation, global trends in education, and the Japanese educational policies, transformational changes are needed toward a new era of Japanese public health education specifically through outcome-based education to improve the health professionals competencies. We hope that education in the new schools of public health will contribute to solve authentic public health problems and create a healthy future with competent professionals.

AB  - The National Center for Healthcare Leadership transformational leadership project is a broad and ambitious initiative that seeks to bring to the table top leaders from industry and academe. Their charge is to accomplish nothing short of resetting the course for health management education and practice in the coming decades. Four councils were recruited to launch the four major interventions: (1) recruitment and diversity, (2) core competencies, (3) the advanced learning institute, and (4) accreditation and certification. After describing intervention goals, we provide examples of baseline measures for tracking educational and performance outcomes longitudinally. We believe this transformation is only beginning, and it will take many years or decades. The transformation will be most successful if it is guided by data and systematic evaluation.

AB  - The critical role of village cadres in China’s rural development, especially western rural development, has attracted significant academic attention. However, existing research mainly focuses on qualitative discussions at the institutional level, and fewer studies are in-depth empirical investigations. Using field survey data of rural areas in Shaanxi Province of China in 2011, an in-depth empirical investigation of the relationship between village cadre competency and rural development, as well as the moderating effect of the village cadre social capital in this relationship, were explored in this study. Results show that three dimensions of village cadre competency (i.e. achievement motivation, individual influence and administrative leadership capabilities) are positively correlated with rural development. Achievement motivation of village cadres can stimulate individual behaviors, and individual influence and administrative leadership capabilities can benefit the establishment of a confidence mechanism and promote social innovation. Furthermore, the social capital of village cadres strengthens the positive relationship between village cadre competency and rural development. When village cadres possess richer network resources in social capital, their competency can easily promote rural development through mobilization of the social structure. The results obtained in this study reveal the relationships between village cadre competency, social capital, and rural development, which also support the discussion of social transformational development in rural areas at the micro-level to a certain extent. © 2016, Editura Lumen.

AB  - This study investigates the cultural and ideological underpinnings of educational leadership within higher education institutions (HEIs) and assesses their impact on fostering innovation in teaching and management. Our research reveals a nuanced relationship between varied leadership styles, institutional cultures, and the drive for innovation. Notably, transformational leadership aligns strongly with innovative outcomes and a collaborative institutional ethos, in contrast to the more rigid structures associated with authoritarian and laissez-faire leadership styles. The philosophical core of this inquiry lies in examining how leadership practices embody and promote ethical values that influence collective and individual success. Institutions that cultivate a culture of collaboration and are open to embracing risk are found to be more conducive to innovation. In contrast, settings that emphasize rigid hierarchies and prioritize individual achievement tend to stifle creative and innovative practices. Our findings emphasize the crucial role of leaders in shaping an ethical climate that nurtures innovation. Effective leadership is pivotal in fostering an environment supportive of progressive teaching and management strategies. This includes investing in faculty development, enhancing collaborative efforts, and acknowledging academic excellence. Moreover, the strategic integration of technology and a shift towards student-centred learning are identified as essential for advancing innovative teaching practices. By delving into the philosophical and ethical dimensions of educational leadership, this study contributes to a deeper understanding of how leadership rooted in ethical and collaborative values can profoundly impact educational innovation and success. The insights gained underscore the potential for educational leaders to drive significant change by adhering to philosophically and ethically sound practices. © (2024), (European Journal for Philosophy of Religion).

AB  - It is believed that without high-performing leaders in an educational organization as well as committed academic staff, student academic achievement would be affected, the management will collapse and the overall quality of education will deteriorate. Hence, this research explores the relationship between transformational leadership styles of Heads of Departments and organizational commitment of academic staff in Polytechnic Kuching Sarawak. A total of 165 academic staff from eight major departments were involved in this quantitative research. The findings showed that the Heads of Departments practiced a high level of transformational leadership styles. Besides that, the level of organizational commitment among the academic staff was proven to be high. The findings also revealed that a significant relationship existed between transformational leadership style of Heads of Departments and organizational commitment of academic staff in Polytechnic Kuching Sarawak. This research contributes to the development of an organization by encouraging other polytechnics to practice transformational leadership style to ensure academic staff commitment leading to a more effective and sustainable organization. © 2018, University of Malaya.

AB  - Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the multi-layer effect of transformational leadership (TL) on employee-related outcomes, i.e. relational identification (RI) and satisfaction with leader (SWL). Further, role of leader member exchange (LMX) and the association period in between TL and RI as well as SWL shall also be examined. So, the present paper attempts to evaluate the moderated-mediated effect of TL on RI and SWL. Design/methodology/approach – The model has been tested in the higher education sector. Information regarding TL, LMX, SWL and RI has been procured from teachers. The data have been duly validated with the help of confirmatory factor analysis. Reliability has been assessed through Cronbach’s α and composite reliability. Structural equation modelling has been used for testing the hypotheses. Moderation has been checked through multi-group analysis. Findings – The results indicate that association period moderates the TL and LMX relationship. LMX mediates the TL and RI and SWL relationship. Finally, moderated- mediated impact of TL on RI and SWL have been found. Managerial, practical, social, economic implications and scope for future research have also been discussed. Research limitations/implications – This study represents a cross-sectional investigations as responses were gathered from respondents at a particular point of time. Moreover, the study is confined to government degree colleges operating in Jammu district only. In future longitudinal study can be conducted. Comparative study between private and public colleges can be undertaken in future. Practical implications – Leaders should focus on creating positive environment, where personal work goals of the subordinates are linked with organisational goals, with the help of role-person integration. Leaders should make their decisions more transparent by exhibiting consistency in their logic and reasoning. Remaining impartial in decision making will help leaders to instil trust and respect in the minds of subordinates. Trust among the followers can be increased through commitments and achievement of goals. Leaders should create more enthusiasm and optimism amongst the employees. Social implications – Leaders in education institutes should create social and emotional learning environment in the colleges. This can be done by arranging informal meetings, some kinds of fares, painting competitions and festive celebrations at collaborative level. This strategic action will help to provide an opportunity to all employees’ to come forward in an informal friendly environment, which will help to reduce stress, anxiety, and depression; and improve the quality of relationship and ultimately enhance satisfaction among followers’ with respect to their leaders. The followers work for the achievement of departmental as well as the organisational goals in collaboration with their leaders. Originality/value – The paper has evaluated the moderation of association period between TL and LMX relationship in higher education sector which has not been explored earlier in leadership studies. Many studies have evaluated the direct impact but moderated-mediated impact of TL on RI and SWL has not been evaluated earlier, which will contribute equally to academic as well as business world. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - The impact of leadership styles on staff performance and competency within higher education institutions is significant. This study conducts a comprehensive evaluation of current literature to examine the effects of several leadership styles, such as transformational, transactional, servant, and authentic leadership, on employee performance and competency. The main goal is to determine the impact of various leadership styles on the efficiency and contentment of employees in academic environments in shaping the values and culture of employees through the organizational strategies they implement. The technique included a Systematic Literature Review (SLR), utilising data from Scopus and Google Scholar, and implementing a meticulous selection process to incorporate pertinent research published from 2020 to 2024. 15 papers were examined, specifically investigating the correlation between leadership styles, employee performance, and competency. The results indicate that transformational leadership has a highly substantial beneficial influence on performance and competency, promoting creativity and employee engagement. Transactional leadership, although successful in ensuring stability and providing incentives for achievement, yields inconsistent outcomes. The servant and authentic leadership styles have a beneficial impact on employee satisfaction and organisational commitment, which in turn leads to enhanced performance. On the other hand, laissez-faire leadership is linked to adverse consequences, such as reduced motivation and productivity. The study asserts that comprehending and embracing the suitable leadership approach is crucial for augmenting employee performance and proficiency in higher education institutions. This research makes a significant addition by delivering a thorough analysis of how different leadership styles impact academic personnel may vary depending on the institutional context and organizational culture. It provides vital insights for academic leaders to enhance the efficacy of their institutions. © (2024), (Elite Scientific Publications). All rights reserved.

AB  - Purpose: This study aims to review the last 50 years of academic research on collective leadership (CL) and how far it has progressed by using the Scopus database and the science mapping technique of bibliometric analysis. Design/methodology/approach: This study has analysed 417 publications from the Scopus database on collective leadership from 1967 to 2023. Data were analysed using MS Excel and VOSviewer. Findings: There has been research from different parts of the world on the various aspects of collective leadership. In recent years, collective leadership research has gained momentum. However, collective leadership is still at a nascent level when it comes to the applicability of the concepts. So far, the research on collective leadership has relied on themes such as shared leadership and distributed leadership, how collective leadership differs from other similar-looking leadership styles such as transformational leadership, and how this influences followers’ outcomes such as team effectiveness, achievements, relations, commitment, etc. Most of the research so far has been done in the United States of America, the UK and the Australian context. There exists a huge gap for studying collective leadership in African, Middle Eastern and Asian contexts. Research limitations/implications: Collective leadership research trends may be addressed to enable academics and practitioners to better understand current and future trends and research directions. Future studies in this field might use the findings as a starting point to highlight the nature of the topic. Originality/value: Bibliometric techniques provide a far more comprehensive and reliable picture of the field. This article has the potential to serve as a one-stop resource for researchers and practitioners seeking information that can aid in transdisciplinary endeavours by leading them to recognized, peer-reviewed papers, journals and networks. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Background/purpose: This study aims to investigate the influence of leadership (principal and teacher leadership) and school climate on student achievement as well as the moderating effect of some variables in this relationship. Materials/methods: With this purpose, a meta-analysis of data gathered from a total of 90 empirical studies including 83,337 participants was performed. The random effects model was utilized to measure the overall effect sizes. Results: The results showed that leadership and school climate had a moderate effect on academic achievement. In the USA context, organizational climate, principal leadership, and teacher leadership affected student achievement respectively. However, in the Turkish context, teacher leadership had a greater influence on student achievement the school climate, and principal leadership. The analysis also revealed that the influence of leadership on student achievement was attained through transformational, supportive, distributed, and instructional leadership practices respectively. Among the moderators tested, only the education level was determined to moderate the effect of school climate on student achievement. It was also concluded that an open organizational climate in primary schools had a greater effect on academic achievement. Conclusion: The current study evidenced that leadership and school climate are significant variables in improving student achievement. © The Author(s), 2025.

AB  - Learning outcomes: Analyze: Examine the role of cultural fit in job satisfaction and organizational effectiveness, using theoretical frameworks such as Hofstede’s Cultural Dimensions and Person–Organization Fit Theory. Analyze how ShowVista’s opaque decision-making and performance metrics, leadership communication and recognition practices influenced Brown’s engagement and performance. Evaluate: Assess the impact of recognition, or the lack thereof, on employee motivation and retention using Herzberg’s Two-Factor Theory and Self-Determination Theory. Create: Design actionable strategies for Brown to navigate cultural and organizational challenges, incorporating tools such as cultural intelligence and transformational leadership principles. Synthesize: Integrate insights from organizational behavior and HR theories to develop a comprehensive plan for ShowVista, addressing both individual and systemic challenges. Reflect: Encourage students to introspect on their personal values and cultural adaptability, drawing parallels between Brown’s dilemma and their own potential career challenges. Case overview/synopsis: In “Cultural Collisions: The Struggle for Recognition in a Cross-Cultural Workplace,” Alex Brown, the National Marketing Head at ShowVista, faces mounting frustration as his contributions to the company’s success go unrecognized. Despite spearheading innovative marketing strategies that boosted revenue, Brown finds himself sidelined in an organization where hierarchy, consensus-driven decision-making and relationship-based leadership take precedence over individual achievement. ShowVista’s Indian-influenced corporate culture clashes with Brown’s results-oriented, recognition-driven mindset, leaving him isolated and undervalued. His attempts to implement data-driven approaches are met with resistance, while credit for his successes is often attributed to senior executives. The strain of navigating an unfamiliar work culture, compounded by personal sacrifices, forces Brown to question his future at the company. As he stands at a crossroads, he must decide whether to adapt to ShowVista’s norms or seek an organization that aligns with his values. The case examines the complexities of cultural fit, leadership role in a multicultural organization and career identity in a global workplace. Complexity academic level: Case is suited for teaching in MBA and Executive Courses. Supplementary material: Teaching notes are available for educators only.

AB  - The monograph reflects and scientifically and methodologically substantiates ways to solve urgent problems of the theory and practice of training officers of the National Police in terms of the quality of higher education in the context of the imperative of human-dimensional meanings, taking into account studies of Ukrainian psychological, pedagogical, legal comparative studies. In the most general form, the material is presented regarding the strategic guidelines for the quality of education in the WHE with special learning conditions in the context of Ukraine's integration into the European educational space. Philosophical and methodological approaches to solving existing disagreements in the field of human measurement of the quality of police education in Ukraine and abroad are studied in integral connection with the corresponding concepts of human development; leadership theories; the genesis of personnel work on professional training and evaluation of the activities of police officers in the system of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Ukraine. Features of the human-measurement training of officers of the National Police of Ukraine are explained on the basis of the provisions of the modern post-non-classical methodology of science, a general scientific holistic approach, humanistic pedagogy, as well as the methodological foundations for the implementation of international standards of ethical behavior in the activities of police officers, which is an objective need of the current Ukrainian education system in general and in particular, a prerequisite for the prevention of corruption offenses, the vitality of virtue in society. The productivity of reflexive practices of self-organization of the personality of future police officers is substantiated as a condition for the development of psychological resilience. The book proves the necessity and prospects of research and implementation in the theory and practice of police education of the concept of Ukrainian general scientific methodology regarding the unity of the formation and development of a Human on the basis of the cognitive-emotional-volitional triad of components of the value experience of the individual. Based on the real originality of the formation of the value experience of a police officer in the process of professional training, constructive practice, the general theoretical and methodological origins and meaningful lines of practical improvement and further personal and professional growth of a police officer in their official activities as mechanisms for protecting human rights and freedoms in the activities of law enforcement officers are identified. The novelty of the approaches is associated with the use of the key foundations of psychopedagogical support and the development of pedagogical skills of HEI teachers with special learning conditions, the activities of mentors to harmonize the professional training of the applicant's personality in the system of departmental education, the use of a criteria approach for assessing learning outcomes, the design features of police work programs in the context of the scale of human-dimensional meanings evaluating the quality of higher education The constructiveness of this perspective is distinguished, first of all, by a holistic combination and use as the latest achievements of the psychological, pedagogical, legal, neurophysiological branches of scientific knowledge to explain the newly formed pedagogical phenomena of the modern educational sphere in the aspect of innovativeness of markers for assessing the quality of educational and research activities education; and the understanding that universal human and nation-creating value orientations as a special social basis of the culturological worldview should be extrapolated into the global function of modern education, which should determine and realize its social power that characterizes civilizational development in different historical epochs. In this context, the issues of introducing the axiological essence, designing, implementing and evaluating the relevant educational programs for training officers of the National Police are specified. In general, the developments contained in this collective monograph will be suitable for use in the pedagogical and psychological support of educational activities for the training of police officers both in the framework of formal and non-formal education. © All rights reserved.

AB  - The advantages of suburban life do not necessarily guarantee a secure future for many young people of color. A recent US study indicates that despite being raised in elite neighborhoods, Black males raised in affluent conditions are less likely than White males to maintain their wealth status into adulthood. While strong instruction, adult support, and inclusive cultures have been proven to mitigate a myriad of risk factors for historically marginalized groups of students, opportunity gaps continue to face young people of color, even in affluent suburban districts, where the appearance of a level playing field can lead educators to underestimate their role in building social capital in their students. High graduation rates notwithstanding, school leaders in suburban districts must be prepared to lead staff to understand the critical impact of disparities in preparation on the competitiveness of their students of color and firstgeneration students. They must seek to uncover critical differences in how opportunities are parceled out, address subtle barriers to access, resist the “opportunity hoarding” that works to maintain the status quo in many districts, and develop in staff the pedagogical and relational skills that engage students of color in the highest opportunities available to them. Though many school administrators may be White, middle class, and personally unfamiliar with some of the racial and socioeconomic challenges that face many suburban districts today, their effectiveness in eliminating achievement and opportunity gaps will hinge on their ability to prepare all students for competition on a playing field that remains anything but level. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.

AB  - Integrating Education 4.0 in higher education necessitates a transformational leadership approach that champions innovation and technology adoption. This paper reviews the impact of transformational leadership in fostering a conducive environment for Education 4.0, emphasising personalised and technology-enhanced learning experiences. With their vision and motivational prowess, transformational leaders are crucial in steering educational institutions through digital transformation, encouraging the adoption of advanced technologies like artificial intelligence, virtual reality, and data analytics. These leaders are pivotal in nurturing a culture of continuous improvement and empowerment, actively involving team members in pursuing collective achievements and personal growth. The study highlights the importance of transformational leadership in addressing the dynamic challenges and opportunities presented by Education 4.0. By inspiring educators and students to embrace change, transformational leaders facilitate the integration of innovative teaching methods and technologies, enhancing learning outcomes and preparing students for the demands of the digital age. The findings suggest that transformational leadership is instrumental in creating a flexible, relevant, and forward-thinking educational environment that aligns with the objectives of Education 4.0. This paper advocates strategically emphasising the development of transformational leaders within academic institutions. Such leadership is essential for navigating the complexities of digital-area education, ensuring institutions remain adaptive and responsive to technological advancements, and equipping students with the necessary skills to thrive in a rapidly evolving landscape. © 2024 by author(s).

AB  - Background: Concurrent with the evolving role of the department chair in academic medicine is the entry of women physicians into chair positions. Because implicit biases that stereotypically masculine behaviors are required for effective leadership remain strong, examining faculty members' perceptions of their chair's leadership in medical school departments with women chairs can provide insight into the views of women leaders in academic medicine and the complex ways in which gender may impact these chairs' leadership style and actions. Methods: We conducted semistructured interviews with 13 male and 15 female faculty members representing all faculty tracks in three clinical departments chaired by women. Inductive, qualitative analysis of the subsequent text allowed themes to emerge across interviews. Results: Four themes emerged regarding departmental leadership. One dealt with the leadership of the previous chair. The other three described the current chair's characteristics (tough, direct, and transparent), her use of communal actions to help support and mentor her faculty, and her ability to build power through consensus. Because all three chairs were early in their tenure, a wait and see attitude was frequently expressed. Faculty generally viewed having a woman chair as an indication of positive change, with potential individual and institutional advantages. Conclusions: This exploratory study suggests that the culture of academic medicine has moved beyond questioning women physicians' competence to lead once they are in top organizational leadership positions. The findings are also consonant with experimental research indicating that women leaders are most successful when they pair stereotypic male (agentic) behaviors with stereotypic female (communal) behaviors. All three chairs exhibited features of a transformational leadership style and characteristics deemed essential for effective leadership in academic medicine. Copyright 2010, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

AB  - School leadership matters. After teachers and teaching, school leadership is the most important determinant of learner achievement in school. Despite this, there is still uncertainty regarding what successful school leadership is and what successful school leaders do in non-Western contexts. In this mixed methods study I explored successful high school leadership in South Africa. Specifically, a questionnaire was administered to 38 principals from academically high-achieving schools from a range of socioeconomic contexts throughout the Western Cape, and 14 principals were interviewed. An integrated analysis reveals the paradox of uniqueness and universality of successful school leadership in South Africa, outlining that while there is no single best approach, various similarities exist between successful school leaders and established international literature. I found that successful principals adapt to their context, amalgamate transformational, instructional and distributed leadership styles, set direction, develop people, constantly realign the school with teaching and learning, and, importantly, strive to make a difference in the lives of others. It is about leading with Ubuntu. By highlighting these characteristics and practices, I offer theoretical, practical and personal advice to current and aspiring school leaders, academics and policy makers. © 2023, South African Journal Of Education.

AB  - In 2013, Abertay University undertook a root and branch review of pedagogic policies and practices, catalysed by the university’s new teaching and learning enhancement strategy. What is quite remarkable about these changes is their extent and the pace of their implementation. Transformation have included: curriculum (module credit size, new electives, portfolio review, programme redesign), assessment and feedback (electronic management of assessment, new literal grading scale, introduction of GPA and the Higher Education Achievement Report, HEAR), and academic staff development (revised postgraduate certificate in teaching, new accredited CPD scheme, funding for teaching innovation and creating a new, strong community of practice). The university’s size (4000 students, 200 academic staff) has been a helpful factor, however, key has been a novel change management approach developed by the Abertay senior team. This approach can be summarised as 6Ps: Purpose, Principles, Participation, Practice, Pace, and Pre-mortem. This chapter explores the academic leadership and management aspects of the transformational changes introduced, the processes adopted, the success of the strategy’s implementation, and how leaders and managers were supported throughout the process by a programme of university-provided structured CPD. Finally, the authors reflect on the challenges and wider lessons learned of this major institutional initiative. © 2020 selection and editorial matter, Jackie Potter and Cristina Devecchi; individual chapters, the contributors.

AB  - Demand for postgraduate qualifications in medical education can be judged by the increase in providers worldwide over the last two decades. However, research into the impact of such courses on identity formation of healthcare professionals is limited. This study investigates the influence of such programmes on graduates’ educational identities, practices and career progression. Informed by constructivist grounded theory (CGT), semi-structured interviews were conducted with 27 graduates (2008–2012) from one postgraduate programme, who were at different stages in their careers worldwide. The audio data were transcribed and analysed using a CGT approach. Participants enrolled in award-bearing medical education courses for various intrinsic and extrinsic reasons. The findings from this study highlight their development as educators, and educational researchers, leaders and learners, as their self-efficacy in educational practices and engagement in scholarly activities increased. Graduates attributed career progression to the qualification, with many being promoted into senior positions. They also described substantial performance attainments in the workplace. The findings contribute to understanding the complexity and nuances of educational identity formation of healthcare professionals. A qualification in medical education encouraged transformational changes and epistemological development as an educator. Awareness of these findings will inform both those considering enrolment and those supporting them of potential benefits of these programmes. © 2018, The Author(s).

AB  - In a transmodern world, the current research finds commonalities between the Semiotics of Discourse (Paris School) which is intertwined with other fields such as linguistics, and coaching. The main problem and hypothesis of the present research is to argue that the Semiotics of Discourse (Paris School) can provide ʻpart ofʼ a comprehensive theoretical framework for conceptualizing coaching and its development as an academic discipline and subdiscipline. Therefore, adopting a descriptive-analytic method based on Fontanille's ideas (Fontanille, 2003, as translated by Bostic, 2006) in analyzing and solving a case study of one of her clients in coaching, and introducing the term ʻKhodnavardiʼ being established and registered in Iran by her, the author examines this problem and hypothesis. In order to make linguistics (its types and subdisciplines), semiotics (its types, and other fields intertwined with it), and other possible, probable fields, institutions, practitioners, skills, and sciences more practical, the current and future objective of this inquiry is to elementarily introduce the process of coaching discourse as an object and corpus of transdisciplinary studies. This trajectory will finally provide the context for the localization of the academic discipline, subdiscipline, and new profession of coaching, and subsequently coaching education and studies, and coaching training: A kind of localization, entrepreneurship and job creation. Pointing out the similarities between the Semiotics of Discourse (Paris School) and coaching, and presenting a model based on “Khodnavardi”, the main achievement of this inquiry is suggesting the basics of ʻSemiotic Coachingʼ at an academic level in Iran. In addition, ʻSemiotic Coachingʼ can lead to interactions or commonalities with other fields, institutions, practitioners, skills, and sciences including pragmatism, educational linguistics, edusemiotics, change, transformation, cognitive sciences, philosophy, sociology, psychology, teaching, communication, management, human and organizational resource development, leadership, literature, cinema and theater, etc., and on the other hand, with different types of coaching like linguistic, semantic, ontological, integral, existential, narrative, cognitive, clean language, core energy, neuro-linguistic, academic, developmental, emotional intelligence, and other topics which will not be addressed for the sake of brevity. © 2022, Tarbiat Modares University.

AB  - A widely accepted new leadership approach concerns transactional and transformational leadership. Transactional leadership consists of planning, implementation, and evaluation. Transformational leadership consists of charisma, intellectual stimulation, and individualized consideration that can motivate followers. The six orientations that characterize the Catholic healthcare ministry imply both types of leadership. Fundamental values, knowledge, and skills required for healthcare organization management are acquired through health administration education. The themes prevalent in today's Catholic healthcare ministry and the leadership qualities they imply are addressed by all aspects of such education: degree programs, field experience, continuing education, and research and consultation. Much of a master's degree program concentrates on transactional leadership because its content is better formulated and easier to teach. The development of transformational leadership qualities during master's study primarily provides a foundation on which students can build. Health administration programs in cooperation with healthcare organizations have created three models for field experience: internships, residencies, and fellowships. Many master's programs deliver continuing education programs for both types of leadership, and research and consultation contribute to this education.

AB  - This study explores the impact of transformational leadership by teachers on academic achievement among students in applied universities in Hebei Province, China. Furthermore, the study examines the roles of psychological capital, self-regulation, and conscientiousness in the relationship between psychological capital and academic achievement. A questionnaire survey method and convenience sampling were used to collect 719 formal questionnaires. The research results indicate that universities of applied sciences in Hebei Province, China, perceive that a teacher’s transformational leadership has a significant positive impact on students’ academic achievement. Moreover, perceiving a teacher’s transformational leadership has a significant positive impact on students’ psychological capital and self-regulation, both of which have a significant positive impact on academic achievement. Psychological capital and self-regulation mediate the relationship between teachers’ transformational leadership and students’ academic achievement. Furthermore, conscientiousness moderates the relationship between psychological capital and academic achievement. © 2024 Common Ground Research Networks. All rights reserved.

AB  - This work is part of a wider research effort in the field of leadership and organizational development, coordinated by the University of Granada and the A.R.E.A Research Group (Analysis of Educational Reality in Andaluz), HUM/672. It was developed in the Cooperative University of Colombia, a country where technical and technological programmes have been promoted in the past 10 years through institutions of higher education. We build on the idea that knowing the leadership styles of teachers and principals is fundamental. The main objective of the study is thus to formulate achievement strategies to improve the educative centre and the educational community at several levels: as individuals, as groups and as an organization. To this aim we conducted a descriptive research with a non-experimental design by the poll method, through the implementation of the ‘Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire by Bass and Avolio–MLQ’ instrument, administered to teachers and principals of technical-technological programmes of the Cooperative University of Colombia. Results show that the elements of Transformational Leadership are predominant over the other types of Leadership. They thus emerge as the key element to strengthen, through individual training processes and organizational improvement strategies, in order to achieve optimal organizational results. This must be carried out from within the educational entity, through the motivation of students and work groups, strengthening the practices of teachers and principals in the development of basic organizational and academic functions. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - This study explores the impact of Transformational Leadership (TL) on Work Efficiency (WE) and career achievement among university lecturers in Henan Province, China. Specifically, it examines how WE mediate the relationship between TL and lecturers' career achievements. TL, characterised by its ability to inspire and motivate followers, was discovered to drive positive organisational change and enhance goal attainment. This research highlights how institutional factors such as leadership decision-making, employee collaboration, and communication influence career trajectories and contribute to career achievement levels. Key milestones in lecturers' careers, such as appointments, promotions, tenure, and professional growth in teaching, research, and leadership, were considered. Factors like academic qualifications, research productivity, teaching experience, and scholarly publications were identified as influential. Furthermore, maintaining high WE are crucial for managing workloads and meeting academic responsibilities. Using a sample of 974 lecturers selected through random sampling and data collected via questionnaires, the study applied quantitative analysis to investigate the correlation between TL behaviours, WE, and career achievements. The findings reveal that TL positively affects lecturers' career achievements, with WE serving as a significant mediating factor. This underscores the importance of TL and efficient work practices in advancing lecturers' careers and enhancing organisational effectiveness. © 2024, Creative Publishing House. All rights reserved.

AB  - The interdisciplinary entrepreneurial team is the key carrier for universities to carry out academic entrepreneurship. Strengthening the internal governance of the interdisciplinary entrepreneurial team in universities is an important measure to enhance the transformation of scientific and technological achievements in universities and boost the construction of the national innovation system. The interdisciplinary entrepreneurial team in universities is the source of the improvement of academic entrepreneurial performance, there is still a lack of systematic and comprehensive theoretical and empirical research on its internal governance. This paper takes interdisciplinary entrepreneurial teams in universities as the study object, analyzes the internal governance mechanism and laws of interdisciplinary entrepreneurial teams in universities theoretically and empirically, and finds that: Transformational leadership has positive impacts on interdisciplinary collaboration and academic entrepreneurial performance in interdisciplinary entrepreneurial teams in universities; Interdisciplinary collaboration plays a partial mediating effect in the relationship between transformational leadership and academic entrepreneurial performance; The relationship conflict in conflict plays both a negative and a positive moderating effect in the relationship between transformational leadership and the different dimensions of interdisciplinary collaboration. The task conflict in conflict has an insignificant negative moderating effect in the relationship between transformational leadership and the quality of collaboration in interdisciplinary collaboration. The findings of this paper emphasize the matching law of the materialization process of the productivity of interdisciplinary entrepreneurial teams in universities, and also provide evidence for the coupling of core elements in the internal governance process of interdisciplinary entrepreneurial teams in universities. The theoretical contribution of this paper are as follows: firstly, there has been controversy over the dimensions of transformational leadership in previous studies. This paper confirms that transformational leadership is a univariate variable and cannot be divided into different dimensions, indicating that there may be important situational elements in the dimension division of transformational leadership. Secondly, based on the interdisciplinary characteristics of interdisciplinary entrepreneurial teams in universities, this paper explores the integration of transformational leadership and interdisciplinary cooperation, two key governance elements that affect the growth and development of interdisciplinary entrepreneurial teams in universities, into the common research model. This not only expands the analytical framework for the performance of transformational leadership in academic entrepreneurial teams, but also systematically depicts and describes the internal governance mechanisms of interdisciplinary entrepreneurial teams in universities, this goes beyond the existing study framework on the separation of transformational leadership and interdisciplinary cooperation, it is an important supplement to both transformational leadership theory and interdisciplinary cooperation theory. Thirdly, this study finds that there are significant differences in the moderating effects of different dimensions of conflict in the relationship between transformational leadership and interdisciplinary cooperation, which breaks through the stereotype that relationship conflict always has a negative impact in previous studies, and is an important supplement to the conflict theory and the theory of competition and cooperation. The practical inspiration of this paper lies in: the paper focuses on the most important internal governance variable of the team - the key role of transformational leadership in the academic entrepreneurial performance of interdisciplinary entrepreneurial teams in universities. At the same time, this paper emphasizes that interdisciplinary cooperation is an important path to improve the internal governance performance of interdisciplinary entrepreneurial teams in universities. Moreover, the paper identifies the different roles that conflict plays in the process of transformational leadership leading interdisciplinary entrepreneurial team members in universities to engage in interdisciplinary cooperation. © 2024 Editorial Department of Studies in Science of Science.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this study was to examine the relative impact of different types of leadership on students' academic and nonacademic outcomes. Research Design: The methodology involved an analysis of findings from 27 published studies of the relationship between leadership and student outcomes. The first meta-analysis, including 22 of the 27 studies, involved a comparison of the effects of transformational and instructional leadership on student outcomes. The second meta-analysis involved a comparison of the effects of five inductively derived sets of leadership practices on student outcomes. Twelve of the studies contributed to this second analysis. Findings: The first meta-analysis indicated that the average effect of instructional leadership on student outcomes was three to four times that of transformational leadership. Inspection of the survey items used to measure school leadership revealed five sets of leadership practices or dimensions: establishing goals and expectations; resourcing strategically; planning, coordinating, and evaluating teaching and the curriculum; promoting and participating in teacher learning and development, and ensuring an orderly and supportive environment. The second meta-analysis revealed strong average effects for the leadership dimension involving promoting and participating in teacher learning and development and moderate effects for the dimensions concerned with goal setting and planning, coordinating, and evaluating teaching and the curriculum. Conclusions and Implications for Research and Practice: The comparisons between transformational and instructional leadership and between the five leadership dimensions suggested that the more leaders focus their relationships, their work, and their learning on the core business of teaching and learning, the greater their influence on student outcomes. The article concludes with a discussion of the need for leadership research and practice to be more closely linked to the evidence on effective teaching and effective teacher learning. Such alignment could increase the impact of school leadership on student outcomes even further. © 2008 The University Council for Educational Administration.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to delve into the characteristics, professional competencies, leadership attitudes, and behaviors of successful school principals (SSPs) in socioeconomically disadvantaged schools. Utilizing a systematic grounded theory method (SGTM), we conducted research in the provinces of Amasya, Çorum, Samsun, and Tokat in Türkiye. Purposeful and theoretical sampling methods were employed to recruit successful school principals, deputy principals, teachers, students, and parents from secondary schools affiliated with the Ministry of National Education (MoNE). The data draws on unstructured individual and focus group interviews, as well as documents and observations. All the data obtained were inductively analyzed through open, axis, and selective coding stages. Based on the codes, sub-categories, categories, themes, and dimensions from the analyses, we designed the Contextual Successful School Principalship Model (CSSPM), which falls into four dimensions as follows: individual, managerial, organizational, and instructional. SSPs in this study mostly tend to display paternalistic leadership attitudes and behaviors in terms of dedication and self-sacrifice, serving, intrinsic motivation, and influencing stakeholders. They exhibit almost all the attitudes and behaviors of servant leadership, act according to some national and moral values, and experience national attitudes such as patriotism and nationalism intensely. By giving importance to the academic socialization of students' mothers, successful school principals exhibit transformational and instructional leadership behaviors. They act strategically to directly involve mothers in enhancing student achievement, demonstrating their commitment to fostering an inclusive and supportive educational environment. © 2024, Ozgen Korkmaz.

AB  - Leadership style is an important aspect in students’ academic performance in schools. Transformational leadership style is associated with the students’ academic achievement in KCSE. The study sought to establish the relationship between idealized influence of principals’ transformational leadership style and students’ academic performance in KCSE in Bomet County in Kenya. The descriptive survey design was used for this study whose target population comprised of 130 secondary schools and five Quality Assurance and Standards Officers in Bomet County. Stratified random sampling procedure was adopted to sample out schools as boys’, girls’ and mixed schools; then Slovin’s formula was used to obtain a total of 108 schools. While purposive sampling procedure was applied to choose one Director of Studies from each 108 schools selected and five Quality Assurance and Standards Officers from the five sub-counties in Bomet County. A total sample of 118 respondents from 108 secondary schools and the five sub-counties participated in the study. When collecting the data, instruments used were Director of Studies’ questionnaires, Quality Assurance and Standards Officers’ interview guides, school and Bomet County Director of Education KCSE records. Chi-square test was adopted to establish the relationship between principals’ idealized influence and academic performance and the results showed that principals’ idealized influence had a strong significant relationship with students’ academic performance in KCSE. Thus, idealized influence characteristics are most effective in promoting students’ academic achievement. The study recommends that the idealized influence should be adopted and displayed by principals in order to improve academic performance in KCSE examinations.

AB  - Objective: To examine associations between management training of physician executives and their leadership styles, as well as effectiveness in achieving disease management goals. Study Design: Cross-sectional national survey. Methods: Executive directors of community health centers (269 respondents; response rate = 40.9%) were surveyed regarding their perceptions of the medical director's leadership, and for quantitative information on the center's achievement of clinical (mostly disease management) goals. The dependent variables were the medical director's scores (as perceived by the executive director) on transformational, transactional, and laissez-faire leadership, effectiveness, satisfaction with the leader, and subordinate extra effort, using an adapted Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire (43 items; 5-point Likert scale). The independent variable was the medical director's management training status. Results: Compared with medical directors with <30 days of in-service training, medical directors with an MHA, MPH, or MBA, or ≥30 days of in-service training, had 0.32, 0.35, 0.30, 0.36, and 0.37 higher scores on transformational leadership, transactional leadership, rated effectiveness, satisfaction, and subordinate extra effort, respectively, and 0.31 lower score on laissez-faire leadership (all P < .001). Medical directors without management degrees but with ≥30 days of in-service training had 0.34, 0.36, 0.50, and 0.47 higher scores on transformational leadership, transactional leadership, rated effectiveness, and satisfaction with the leader (all P < .02). Our data previously had demonstrated that medical directors' transformational leadership significantly influences achievement of disease management goals. Conclusion: Training may enable physician executives to develop leadership styles that are effective in influencing clinical providers' adoption of disease management guidelines under managed care.

AB  - Leadership is a perennially popular topic in the academic and practitioner literature on management. In particular, the past twenty years have witnessed an explosive growth of interest in what has been termed 'transformational leadership' (henceforth, TL). The theory is closely linked to the growth in what has been defined as corporate culturism - an emphasis on the importance of coherent cultures, as a means of securing competitive advantage. This article outlines the central components of TL theory, and subjects the concept to a critical analysis. In particular, similarities are identified between the components concerned and the characteristics of leadership practice in organizations generally defined as cults. This connection has been previously unremarked in the literature. These similarities are comprehensively reviewed. Trends towards what can be defined as corporate cultism in modern management practice are also discussed. We conclude that TL models are overly concerned with the achievement of corporate cohesion to the detriment of internal dissent. Such dissent is a vital ingredient of effective decision-making. It is suggested that more inclusive and participatory models of the leadership process are required.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this article is to detail the results of a large survey based research project which sough to examine the relationships among leadership, organizational learning and teacher and student outcomes.Design A large survey based on questionnaires developed from non-school organizations was used to develop a model to test the nature and strength of the relationships between variables and to understand the interactive nature of leadership and organizational learning and their effects on student outcomes. Model testing employed a latent variables partial least squares path analysis procedure.Findings The results of research have shown that leadership characteristics of a school are important factors in promoting systems and structures that enable the school to be effective and improve, in brief, to operate as a learning organization. School leaders need to be skilled in transformational leadership practices which work, directly and indirectly through others, towards bringing about: consensus in the organization's mission; structures for shared decision making; continual learning through reflective practice; high standards of professionalism; and, a supportive and appreciative climate that promotes a culture of trust and collaboration. The LOLSO research also demonstrates that schools can be identified as learning organizations as they establish sequentially systems and structures of operation that promote: a collaborative and trusting work environment; a shared and monitored mission; empowerment of its members to share decision-making, show initiative and take risks; and, on-going challenging and relevant professional development. These school factors of leadership and organizational learning are shown to influence what happens in the core business of the school; the teaching and learning.Value The article answers two fundamental questions: Does the nature of the leadership and the level of organizational learning in schools contribute to school effectiveness and improvement in terms of the extent of students' participation in school, student academic self-concept and engagement with school? What is the nature of the relationship between non-academic student measures of participation in school, student self-concept and engagement with school and measures of student retention and academic achievement? © 2011 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

AB  - Successful implementation of school-wide interventions (i.e., delivered to all students by a wide array of school personnel) is key to promoting students’ academic achievement and psychosocial development. Yet, the implementation of school-wide interventions is complex and can be psychologically taxing for implementing personnel. If evidence-based practice and program (EBP) implementation goes unsupported, implementation challenges might result in chronic stress among school personnel that leads to burnout. While generally effective leadership tends to decrease educator burnout, implementation-specific leadership may also decrease burnout through its strategic supports for EBP implementation. A series of linear regression and path models were used to examine the concurrent association between transformational (e.g., general) and implementation (e.g., strategic) leadership and burnout and its component parts (i.e., emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, personal accomplishment). In a sample of 338 school personnel, we found transformational and implementation leadership were each significantly associated with decreased burnout. However, transformational leadership was not significantly associated with any of the three burnout components, whereas implementation leadership was significantly associated with increased personal accomplishment. These results suggest both general and strategic forms of leadership are key supports for school personnel burnout and as such, leaders may benefit from training to improve each. Additional implications for schools and future directions to understand how best to support school personnel are discussed. © 2023 American Psychological Association

AB  - Transformational leadership theory was examined in 89 schools in Singapore using a split sample technique (N = 846 teachers). The study sought to examine the influence of transformational leader behavior by school principals as it related to organizational commitment, organizational citizenship behavior, teacher satisfaction with leader, and student academic performance. Attitudinal and behavioral data were collected from both teachers and principals; student academic performance was collected from school records. School level analyses showed that transformational leadership had significant add‐on effects to transactional leadership in the prediction of organizational commitment, organizational citizenship behavior, and teacher satisfaction. Moreover, transformational leadership was found to have indirect effects on student academic achievement. Finally, it was found that transactional leadership had little add‐on effect on transformational leadership in predicting outcomes. Implications and directions for future research are discussed.

AB  - This chapter shows that professional development for urban school leaders must take into account the uniqueness of the urban environment, or else such professional development will be viewed as irrelevant and a waste of time by school leaders who are genuinely committed to improving the academic and sociocultural environment of their schools and school districts. It provides studies on school leadership that were underway in the St. Louis and Kansas City school districts through the Urban School Leadership Consortium. The theory allows for a critical discussion of race, ethnicity, and the influence of community and culture on communications in an urban educational arena. Socioeconomic status is often cited as the most significant correlate to academic achievement. Urban school leaders need to be prepared to understand the persistence of the digital divide in America and how to systematically act on this divide. Consistent with the learner-centered concept, urban school leaders must become transformational in their leadership style. © 2007 by Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Purpose - School culture and school leadership potentially contribute to students' academic achievement, and teachers' satisfaction and productivity. The aim of this study was to identify the relationship between school culture, transformational leadership, and academic achievement among primary school's students. Methodology - This correlational study involved 657 teachers and 141 headmasters from 141 primary schools in Kedah. The School Culture Inventory (SCI) and The Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire were used as survey instruments. Structured interviews which involved 16 teachers and four headmasters were also used to identify positive values that were practiced in school. Findings - The analysis found a significant difference in perceptions of school culture among teachers in high performance schools and teachers in low performance schools. It was also found that school culture had a positive and significant relationship with transformational leadership. Significance - The study indicated that school culture and transformational leadership relates strongly with students' academic achievement. Thus a positive school culture and transformational leadership are expected to contribute to the success of a school.

AB  - Unfortunately, the role of school leadership in fostering school improvement in non-Western countries, especially African countries, is relatively little discussed. The present study sheds light on the contextual role of instructional leadership (IL) and transformational leadership (TL) in promoting the Ethiopian School Improvement Program (SIP), which is intended to enhance student academic performance. Hence, this study aimed to extend the integrated leadership model by conceptualizing the moderating mediation effect of IL on student academic achievement in public primary schools. A cross-sectional study was performed by distributing a survey to 1280 public primary school teachers in Addis Ababa. Surprisingly, the study's findings affirmed that unlike previous studies, IL and TL significantly directly affect student academic performance, and TL plays a significant role as a moderator of the indirect effect of IL on student academic achievement. © 2023 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

AB  - While infusion of technology into schools has been one of the top priorities of the education reform agenda across the world, findings from many large-scale international assessments indicate that students’ use of information and communication technology (ICT) has mixed effects on their academic achievements. In this paper, we argue that these ambivalent findings were due to the oversight of the indirect effects of ICT use mediated by other ICT-related variables. We employed multilevel structural equation modelling to unfold the relationship between students’ ICT use and their academic achievements based on PISA 2015 data. The results indicated that students’ autonomy in ICT use and students’ interest in ICT use were found to have significant positive direct effects on students’ academic achievements at both within-school and between-school levels. These two variables played a significant role in mediating the indirect effects of ICT use outside school for schoolwork and ICT resources on students’ academic achievements. On the contrary, ICT resources and ICT use at school exerted either no direct effect or a negative direct effect on students’ academic achievements and students’ perceived autonomy related to ICT use, suggesting that mere provision and use of ICT resources in school did not necessarily guarantee success in student performance. At the school level, school’s transformational leadership and collaborative climate helped promote students’ autonomy in ICT use © 2022, Educational Technology and Society.All Rights Reserved.

AB  - At present, the integration of educational social networks are acquiring a fundamental role, the use of portable digital tools to support the teaching and learning processes that allow improving the processes of Teaching-Learning (E-A) in the university environment, it is important to highlight in the same way the concept of leadership that was developed in the beginning in the organizational environment to stimulate the workers in the achievement of the established goals, which through time gender that this term was used in other areas such as sports, management and politics. Recently, in the field of education, efforts have been made to develop leadership in a pedagogical, distributed, and transformational manner in the management and teaching teams of institutions in order to improve learning outcomes. The academic community is influenced by an environment of intellectual, social, cultural, and technological development, which converts the beginning teacher into an active agent who must deal with a global reality of uncertain changes. In this context, the collaborative virtual learning environments are assumed as the optimum scenario to board the training and development of the future trainers at university level, generating a critical and reflexive attitude for their formation in the teaching/learning process. The motivation of this paper arises from these reflections with the purpose of analyzing the collaborative spaces in virtual environments as socio-cultural support for university beginning teachers. Based on a qualitative research with a documentary phase, a theoretical comparison was developed to generate analysis categories which allowed to perform a depth interview addressed to teachers from different countries of Latin America and the Caribbean involved in this training. Concerns and expectations emerged within the formative phase of the beginning teachers, characterized by the pursuit of learning processes that do not exist in their training plan to connect them to a virtual and collaborative reality. The paper invites to reflect on the importance of this issue to build a favorable scenario for future generations. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.

AB  - Currently, the university failure rate is around 33% of students starting their studies. Among the main reasons are demanding academic situations and the use of inappropriate coping strategies. Therefore, the aim of this study was to analyze the influence of teacher leadership on academic resilience and motivation, burnout, and academic performance. This study involved 3354 university students. A structural equation model was made to analyze the predictive relationships between the study’s variables. The results showed that teacher leadership positively predicted academic resilience and motivation; academic resilience negatively predicted burnout and positively predicted academic performance; likewise, academic motivation negatively predicted burnout and positively predicted academic performance; finally, burnout negatively predicted academic resilience. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Purpose: This study aims to investigate the significance of an emerging concept – green talent management (TM) and its influence on employees’ innovative work behavior, together with the moderating roles of transformational leadership and artificial intelligence within the context of higher educational institutions. Design/methodology/approach: Two hundred and thirty-five structured questionnaires were administered to the academic staff in five universities located in Northern Cyprus, and the data was analyzed using partial least square structural equation modeling with the aid of WarpPLS (7.0). Findings: This study provides evidences that green hard and soft TM exerts significant influence on employees’ innovative work behavior. Similarly, transformational leadership and artificial intelligence were confirmed to have a significant impact on employees’ innovative work behavior. Moreover, the study found transformational leadership and artificial intelligence to significantly moderate the relationship between green hard TM and employees’ innovative work behavior. Research limitations/implications: The study provides theoretical and managerial implications of findings that will assist the leaders in higher educational institutions in harnessing the potential of green TM in driving their employees’ innovative work behavior toward the achievement of sustainable competitive advantage in the market where they operate. Originality/value: The attention of researchers in the recent time has been on the way to address the challenge facing organizational leaders on how to develop and retain employee that will contribute to the sustainability of their organization toward the achievement of sustainable competitive advantage in the market they operate. Meanwhile, the studies exploring these concerns are limited. In view of this, this study investigates the significance of an emerging concept – green talent management and its influence on employees’ innovative work behavior, together with the moderating roles of transformational leadership and artificial intelligence within the context of higher educational institutions. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this article is to detail the results of a large survey based research project which sough to examine the relationships among leadership, organizational learning and teacher and student outcomes. Design: A large survey based on questionnaires developed from non-school organizations was used to develop a model to test the nature and strength of the relationships between variables and to understand the interactive nature of leadership and organizational learning and their effects on student outcomes. Model testing employed a latent variables partial least squares path analysis procedure. Findings: The results of research have shown that leadership characteristics of a school are important factors in promoting systems and structures that enable the school to be effective and improve, in brief, to operate as a learning organization. School leaders need to be skilled in transformational leadership practices which work, directly and indirectly through others, towards bringing about: consensus in the organization's mission; structures for shared decision making; continual learning through reflective practice; high standards of professionalism; and, a supportive and appreciative climate that promotes a culture of trust and collaboration. The LOLSO research also demonstrates that schools can be identified as learning organizations as they establish sequentially systems and structures of operation that promote: a collaborative and trusting work environment; a shared and monitored mission; empowerment of its members to share decision-making, show initiative and take risks; and, on-going challenging and relevant professional development. These school factors of leadership and organizational learning are shown to influence what happens in the core business of the school; the teaching and learning. Value: The article answers two fundamental questions: Does the nature of the leadership and the level of organizational learning in schools contribute to school effectiveness and improvement in terms of the extent of students' participation in school, student academic self-concept and engagement with school? What is the nature of the relationship between non-academic student measures of participation in school, student self-concept and engagement with school and measures of student retention and academic achievement? © 2011 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

AB  - This study, based on the qualitatively rendered experiences and perceptions of educational leaders from historically underserved backgrounds in the US, argues that identity impacts leadership practice. To make this point, researchers build upon an emergent theoretical framework for applied critical leadership from the theories and traditions of transformational leadership, personal leadership, critical pedagogy, and critical race theory. With regard to methodology, a two-subject case study was validated by adding three additional participants for points of verification to the findings and discussion. Interview, field notes, and relevant documents were analyzed using phenomenology and constant comparative methods. Major findings indicate participants' practice reveal characteristics of cross-cultural applied, critical, and transformational leadership. These scholarly findings are significant because they can inform mainstream leadership practices contributing to educational equity, authentic multiculturalism, improved intercultural relations, innovation, increased academic achievement, and sustainable educational change. © 2014 © 2014 University of Cambridge, Faculty of Education.
