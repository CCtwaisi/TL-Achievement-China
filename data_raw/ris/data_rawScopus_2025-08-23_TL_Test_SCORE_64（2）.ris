AB  - Guided by Bass and Avolio's leadership frameworks and Hofstede's modified cultural dimensions, the present cross-cultural study aims to compare and explore the relationships between cultural values and anticipated female leadership styles in nonprofit organizations in Taiwan and the United States. Regression and t-test analyses of 307 participants in 138 Rotary Clubs in the two societies reveal two research findings. First, Rotary Club members in Taiwan have higher scores in all the cultural dimensions of collectivism, masculinity, and lifelong relationships than their U.S. counterparts. Second, transformational leadership proves to be the most anticipated leadership style among Rotary Club members in both cultures. The research findings indicate that culture alone cannot account for the anticipated female leadership styles. Therefore, a combination of Bass's culturally universal approach and Hofstede's culturally specific approach is proposed to tackle more variables in future female leadership studies. ©Baker College 2011.

AB  - Background: Ethical competency is important to head nurses’ transformational leadership, however, few researches have explored their correlation, Additionally, most studies used variable-oriented approach to examine ethical competence, without considering it as a multidimensional concept. This study aimed to identify the latent profiles of head nurses’ ethical competence and examine differences in transformational leadership across latent profiles. Methods: Convenience sampling was used to recruit 329 head nurses from four tertiary hospitals in Changsha, Hunan province, China. This study collected data by using social-demographic survey, Ethical Competence Questionnaire, and Head Nurse’s Transformational Leadership Self-rating Scale between July and August 2023. Latent profile analysis (LPA) was employed to identify latent profiles of ethical competency. One-way ANOVA test and the Kruskal–Wallis test were used to compare the transformational leadership scores across latent profiles of ethical competency. Results: The mean scores of ethical competence and transformational leadership were 4.045 ± 0.394 and 4.555 ± 0.419, respectively. This study identified three latent profiles of head nurses’ ethical competence, and those profiles labelled “low ethical competence” (n = 60, 18.2%), “moderate ethical competence” (n = 217, 66.0%) and “high ethical competence” (n = 52, 15.8%). The average score of transformational leadership was also statistically different (F = 26.446, p = 0.000) across the three profiles. Conclusion: Our findings underscore the importance of tailoring interventions to address the varying profiles of ethical competence among head nurses. Enhancing ethical competence can strengthen transformational leadership, ultimately leading to improved patient outcomes and overall healthcare quality. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Background/Aims Leadership plays a crucial role in many professions, especially in challenging positions such as emergency medical service jobs. The purpose of this study was to explore the relationship between managers' leadership styles and emergency medical technicians' job satisfaction. Method This is a descriptive and cross-sectional study that was carried out in 2010. The research population included 21 managers and 87 emergency medical technicians working in 23 stations in Isfahan city, Iran. The main tools used for data accumulation were the Multiple Leadership Questionnaire for evaluating leadership styles and the Job Descriptive Index for measuring job satisfaction levels. Also, the Pearson correlation analysis test was used to evaluate the relationship between leadership style and job satisfaction. Results Among both managers and technicians, the highest mean score related to the transformational management style, whereas the lowest mean score related to the laissez-faire management style. Moreover, a significant relationship (P<0.01) was found between the transformational and transactional leadership styles and job satisfaction. However, no significant relationship was observed between the laissez-faire management style and job satisfaction. Conclusion Considering the importance of job satisfaction in medical emergencies, it is recommended that health sector policy makers should provide the groundwork for implementing the transformational leadership style to enhance job satisfaction of the medical emergency staff.

AB  - Background: Parental handling is an important element in promotion of positive mental health in adolescents. The Emotional Intelligence of parents and their parenting style are critical elements governing the nature of parent-child dyadic relationships. Aim: This study examined the role of Emotional Intelligence (EI) of parents and Perceived Parental Leadership Behaviour on adolescents' degree of satisfaction with parents. Method: Data was collected from 200 working parent and their adolescent off-springs wherein, parents completed the Mayer, Salovey and Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test (MSCEIT) and the adolescents were administered the Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire (MLQ), and Adolescent Family life Satisfaction Index; Parent subscale. Results: Overall EI of parents showed a significant positive correlation (r=0.19, p<0.01) with adolescents' satisfaction scores. A significant positive correlation was seen between Satisfactions scores and all the Transformational aspects (r score ranging from 0.46 to 0.35, p<0.01) as well as Contingency Reward (r= 0.35, p<.01). Multiple regressions analysis results led to emergence of Intellectual Stimulation (β =.21, ΔR2= 0.21, p<.01), Individualized Consideration (β =.18, ΔR2= 0.28, p<.01) and Idealized Influence (β =.16, ΔR2= 0.29, p<.01) as a positive predictors of parental satisfaction. Laissez- Faire Leadership (β = -.15, ΔR2= 0.25, p<.01) and Management by Exception- Passive (β = -.14, ΔR2= 0.31, p<.01) emerged as negative predictors. Emotional Intelligence failed to emerge as a predictor of satisfaction scores. Conclusion: While EI has been upheld as an important trait that boosts interpersonal relationships, Parental Leadership style seem to have a greater impact on adolescent's satisfaction with parents. The findings hold significant implications for Parental Skills enhancement endeavours.

AB  - This study aims to explore whether there is a relationship between the leadership style of school principals and the performance of their students. For this purpose, a multiple case study was developed in three private subsidized schools in a city on Northern Chile. The multiple case study included the application of a questionnaire, semi-structured interviews to members of the principal's work team who participated in the study in the three schools, and the consideration of the score obtained by the establishment in a test used for measuring learning outcomes (SIMCE test). Results suggest that in the case of the three schools, transformational leadership has a positive impact on student outcomes. Additionally, unlike what is stated in other studies, transactional leadership is also a key determinant for the achievement obtained by students. Thus, this exploratory research validates the dimensions of the styles of transformational and transactional leadership, contributing to new findings that allow continuing with quantitative larger studies.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate what kind of leadership young innovative people prefer and whether their level of innovativeness has an influence on those leadership preferences. It also asks specifically whether some leadership behaviours are preferred over others by young innovators, by comparing that group’s preferences to those of the majority of young people and an outlier group labelled laggards. Leadership preferences are studied in the context of transformational leadership covering transformational leadership, transactional leadership (including passive and active management by exception), rewarding, laissez-faire and authoritative leadership styles. Design/methodology/approach: In total, 297 Finnish university students completed a voluntary leadership behaviour questionnaire and an innovativeness scale. A non-parametric independent samples median test was run to determine if there were differences in the leadership preference score between the innovativeness level groups. Findings: Results indicate that the level of innovativeness influences leadership preferences. Receiving intellectual stimulation from their leader is more important to young innovators than it is to their peers but the former are also less comfortable with active management by exception. Originality/value: Young innovators leadership preferences have not been studied. Harnessing the full power of this important talent pool is central to the future competitiveness of organizations and nations. This study intends to prompt discussion and studies on how to lead young innovators given their preferences. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - Educational leaders have been held increasingly accountable for demonstrating significant gains in student achievement in the wake of education reform policies such as No Child Left Behind. This achievement is often defined as positive gains in attendance and test scores as discipline referrals and suspension numbers decrease. Socioeconomic and cultural contributions to student achievement are often relegated to secondary analyses, are used as deficit explanations when achievement is not increased, or are ignored completely. While this approach may give a snapshot of conditions at a given moment, it does not provide program evaluators with enough information to appropriately assess the implementation of interventions. This qualitative study examines the implementation and evaluation of a prosocial intervention in 10 schools serving American Indian families designed to reflect the culture of program participants and community stakeholders. Findings of the study demonstrate that the relationship between leadership and evaluation participants improved as they worked as partners rather than in isolation. Additionally, gains in prosocial student behavior were observed when traditional evaluation methods were suspended for more culturally appropriate methods that allowed for greater collaboration and timely modifications based on emerging research. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Background: Although leadership is considered as a key factor in health care, leadership styles and outcomes in nursing homes often remain a black box. Therefore, this study explored leadership styles and leadership outcomes of head nurses and directors of nursing (DoN) in nursing homes based on well-defined leadership concepts. Methods: A multicenter cross-sectional analysis was conducted on baseline data of an ongoing cohort study comprising a convenience sample of nursing home staff (n = 302). Leadership styles and leadership outcomes of head nurses and DoN were measured through the rater form of the Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire 5X (MLQ-5X). Based on the Full Range of Leadership Model, the MLQ-5X visualizes transformational (relation and change focused), transactional (task-focused) and passive-avoidant (absence of leadership) leadership styles. Scores of head nurses and DoN for leadership styles and outcomes were compared with European Reference Scores (ERS) using two-sided one-sample t-tests. Results: Compared with ERS, head nurses and DoN scored significantly lower (p < 0.001) on transformational and transactional leadership styles and significantly higher (p < 0.001) on passive-avoidant leadership styles. All leadership outcomes were significantly lower (p < 0.001) for head nurses. Similar results, however not statistically significant, were found concerning leadership outcomes of DoN. Conclusions: Results indicate that passive-avoidant leadership styles are excessively present in contrast to transformational leadership styles in nursing homes. This highlights an urgent need to invest in leadership development. Therefore, future research should focus on interventions for the development of transformational leadership. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  -                              Purpose: Primary care physicians have to deal with many aspects of the patients’ health problem, which needs cooperation with other health professionals or even nonhealth individuals. To achieve effective results, the primary care physicians should have leadership and coordinating skills, especially when dealing with the health challenges in Asia Pacific region. The care coordinator role of primary care physicians is important to create the bridge between population and health. This study aims to determine the correlation between care coordinator performance and leadership factors among primary care physicians. Materials and methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted, and data collection involved a total of 84 primary care physicians who were randomly selected from a total of 44 subdistricts and worked in 40 randomly selected village government-owned primary healthcare facilities in Jakarta. Pearson’s correlation, independent t-test, and one-way ANOVA were used to measure the correlation between care coordination and clinical leadership, transformational leadership, commitment, job satisfaction, and organizational culture, as well as the sociodemographics of the physicians and the professional practice factors. Multiple regressions were conducted to determine the most important factors influencing care coordinator performance. Results: Respondents were mainly female (94%) with an average age of 36 years and were mostly medical doctors without any additional postgraduate degrees (95.2%). There was no correlation between care coordinator scores and organizational culture or commitment. There were positive and significant correlations between care coordinator scores and clinical leadership score (r=0.66; P<0.001), transformational leadership score (r=0.54; P<0.001), job satisfaction score (r=0.31; P=0.004), physician’s age (r=0.34; P=0.002), length of time since graduation (r=0.30; P=0.005), duration of employment at their health center (r=0.33; P=0.003), training in family medicine (P=0.04), and employment status (P=0.005). The most important factors in care coordinator performance were clinical leadership (r=0.53; P<0.001) and transformational leadership (r=0.23; P=0.03), with the total R                             2                              being 0.47. Conclusion: Clinical leadership and transformational leadership were the most important factors for care coordinator performance. Therefore, the leadership skills of primary care physicians are important to be considered as a certain competency in practice to manage various resources and coordinate with related healthcare providers for controlling patients’ illness as well as dealing with the challenges and managing the overall health.                          © 2018 Werdhani et al.

AB  - Learning continuously evolves, propelled by advancements in science and technology as well as the shifting needs and preferences of students. A critical question arises: Are prospective teachers adequately prepared to adapt to these evolving demands with the necessary competencies? This study addresses this question by investigating the effectiveness of an Integrated Learning Model (ILM) in enhancing key teaching competencies. The research focuses on teaching skills, analytical thinking abilities, academic integrity, and transformational leadership qualities among prospective teachers. The study employs an experimental research design, utilizing a one-group pre-test-post-test methodology to assess the impact of the ILM on 35 students selected through cluster sampling. Data collection instruments included the TPOG for evaluating teaching skills, the ATSI for assessing analytical thinking, the PAAIS-24 for measuring academic integrity, and the GTLS for gauging transformational leadership abilities. The data analysis involved descriptive statistics, paired samples t-tests, and N-gain score analysis. The results indicate a significant positive effect of the ILM on all measured competencies: teaching skills, analytical thinking skills, academic integrity, and transformational leadership. These findings underscore the ILM's potential as a robust framework for developing the competencies necessary for prospective teachers to meet the challenges of modern education. The study suggests that future research should explore the application of ILM in various social contexts, examine its effectiveness in fostering additional relevant competencies, and compare its outcomes with those of other instructional models. Such investigations will contribute to a deeper understanding of ILM's role in preparing teachers for the demands of 21st-century education. © 2024, Universitas Negeri Yogyakarta (Yogyakarta State University).

AB  - The aim of this article is to determine whether a significant relation between the middle schools resources and the capabilities and the quality levels achieved by the students in national learning assessment tests exists or not. For this purpose, a regression with a randomly selected sample of 102 schools from the central region of Chile is carried out. The results indicate that the selection, along with the professors performance evaluation explain the 67.2% variance of the University Selection Test score in the schools sample analyzed. The transformational leadership style at the same time explains both variables under analysis.

AB  - This project asked 202 randomly selected faculty members to evaluate the supportive and defensive communication and leadership behaviors of their department chair. The supportive behavior of problem orientation alone explained 43% of the variance in faculty ratings of chair job effectiveness. On the other hand, empathy explained 68% of the variance in faculty ratings of relational satisfaction with their department chair. In addition, a t test revealed that more effective chairs utilized all 6 of Gibb's supportivecommunication behaviors more, and 5 of 6 defensive behaviors less, than their more negatively evaluated peers. Second, a series of stepwise regression procedures explained 16% of the variance in bureaucracy scores, 69% of the variance in Machiavellianism, and 62% of the variance in transformational leadership. Finally, the communication behaviors of strategy, neutrality, and problem orientation explained 56% of the variance in faculty job satisfaction and strategy, neutrality, evaluation, gender, and age explained 41% of the variance in organizational commitment scores. © 2010 Eastern Communication Association.

AB  - Background: For the purpose of providing excellent patient care, residents need to be strong, effective leaders. The lack of clinical leadership is alarming given the detrimental effects on patient safety. The objective of the study was to assess whether a leadership training addressing transactional and transformational leadership enhances leadership skills in residents. Methods: A volunteer sample of 57 residents from postgraduate year one to four was recruited across a range of medical specialties. The residents took part in an interventional controlled trial. The four-week IMPACT leadership training provided specific strategies for leadership in the clinical environment, addressing transactional (e.g. active control, contingent reward) and transformational leadership skills (e.g. appreciation, inspirational motivation). Transactional and transformational leadership skill performance was rated (1) on the Performance Scale by an external evaluator blinded to the study design and (2) self-assessed transformational and transactional leadership skills. Both measures contained items of the Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire, with higher scores indicating greater leadership skills. Results: Both scores were significantly different between the IMPACT group and the control group. In the IMPACT group, the Performance Scale increased 15% in transactional leadership skill performance (2.10 to 2.86) (intervention effect, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.40 to 1.13; p < .001, eta2 = 0.31) and 14% in transformational leadership skill performance (2.26 to 2.94) (intervention effect, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.27 to 1.09; p < .001, eta2 = 0.22). The self-assessed transactional skills revealed a 4% increase (3.83 to 4.03) (intervention effect, 0.20; 95% CI, 0.08 to 0.33; p < .001, eta2 = 0.18) and a 6% increase in transformational leadership skills (3.54 to 3.86) (intervention effect, 0.31; 95% CI, 0.02 to 0.40; p< .001, eta2 = 0.53). Discussion and conclusions: These findings support the use of the transactional and transformational leadership framework for graduate leadership training. Future studies should incorporate time-latent post-tests, evaluating the stability of the behavioral performance increase. © 2017 Saravo et al.

AB  - Leaders are essential actors in public performance improvement and organizational change. However, a key question has not been adequately addressed in prior literature on the topic: how do leadership processes make a difference? Using data on New York City public schools, this article explores the organizational mechanisms by which a specific form of principal's leadership—transformational leadership—influences objective organizational outcomes as measured by standardized test scores. The empirical results indicate that a principal's transformational leadership style affects student test scores through the mediating effects of purposeful performance information use and stakeholder engagement. © 2016 by The American Society for Public Administration

AB  - According to the cognitive-experiential self theory (CEST), all behavior is guided by two informationprocessing systems: the rational system and the experiential. Previous research with school leaders has shown that the rational system and constructive elements of the experiential system have a strong positive relationship with transformational leadership, as outlined in the Full-Range Leadership Theory. This article reports a pretest, posttest study using an intervention and control group to test whether changes to CEST information-processing systems could bring about changes in transformational leadership. The results of a 10-week, individually delivered coaching intervention program with a small group of school principals showed that there was a significant increase in transformational leadership scores between the pretest and posttest for the intervention group, as rated by school staff. The control group remained unchanged. Qualitative results from interviews indicated that school principals in the intervention group became more aware and reflective about their leadership practice. This study yields initial evidence that increasing rational and constructive thinking can develop the use of transformational leadership techniques. © 2010 University of Phoenix.

AB  - Medical representatives play a critical role in the pharmaceutical companies. However, there is a lack of studies in skills improvement for medical representatives in Thailand. Considering the work context, medical representatives have to demonstrate the self-leadership behaviors and transformational leadership behaviors. Therefore, the aims of this study were to develop a self-transformational leadership scale for medical representatives in Thailand and test the psychometric properties. A sequential exploratory mixed method design was implemented to explore the definition of self-transformational leadership of medical representatives in Thailand. Firstly, each in-depth interviews with eleven key informants were conducted. The interview was tape-recorded and transcribed verbatim. A 34-items scale was generated and distributed. The participants were 347 medical representatives in Thailand. The qualitative results showed the definition and four components of self-transformational leadership specific to work context of medical representatives in Thailand that are self-idealized influence, self-inspirational motivation, self-intellectual stimulation, and individualized consideration. The quantitative results showed that the scale developed from the previous phase was statistically appropriate. The goodness-of-fit indices demonstrated that the self-transformational leadership model was consistent with the empirical data (Chi-square = 1465.57, df = 523, p-value =.00, RMSEA =.07, SRMR =.07, NFI =.90) with a Cronbach’s alpha score of.92. This study contributes to behavioral science research by providing a scale of self-transformational leadership that measures both the internal and external factors that affect self-transformational leadership behaviors. © 2022,Journal of Behavioral Science.

AB  - Objective To understand the current situation of nurses' innovative behavior in China and explore the mediating role of job control between transformational leadership and nurses' innovation behaviors. Methods A questionnaire survey was conducted among 3 987 nurses in 18 hospitals in eastern, central, and western China with the Transformational Leadership Questionnaire, Nurse Innovation Behavior Scale, and Nurse Job Control Scale. Results The mean score of nurses' innovative behaviors was(3.07±0.66). The mediating effect test showed that job control had a mediating effect ((β =0.106, P <0.001) between transformational leadership and nurses' innovation behavior, accounting for 46.09% of the total effect. Conclusion The level of nurses' innovative behavior is at medium. Nurse managers need to improve nurses' job control by changing their leadership style and increasing work authorization to enhance nurses' innovative behavior further.

AB  - Background: Transformational leadership skills are critical to operate effectively in today's healthcare environment. Prelicensure nurses do not often practice these skills in a meaningful way during their undergraduate educational experience. Objectives: This paper describes quantitative pre-post findings from the Kouzes and Posner Student Leadership Practices Inventory to examine students' leadership attributes pre-post engagement in an 18. month undergraduate leadership program. Design: This is a non-experimental convenience study that used a quantitative pre-post survey design collecting data from participants and observers using the 360 Kouzes and Posner Student Leadership Practices Inventory. Settings: A private university in the northeastern region of the United States. Participants: Fourteen junior level nursing students who concurrently participated in a leadership program while concurrently completing their required academic courses for their bachelor's degree in nursing. Methods: Paired sample t-tests were used to determine if there was statistical significance among student participants' and observers' perceptions of specific leadership behaviors and skills of students at the onset (pretest) and at the conclusion (posttest) of the leadership program. Results: Participant and observer scores were positively correlated and statistical significance was identified in several practice areas. Conclusions: It is important to integrate transformation leadership skills into undergraduate curriculum since it supports students' engagement in their own learning and instills foundational knowledge critical to their leadership trajectory. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Purpose: The aims of this study are threefold: to examine the relationship between gender role stereotypes and requisite managerial characteristics, to test Lord and Maher's recognition-based processes to determine whether familiarity with women in leadership positions decreases the "think manager-think male" stereotype and to examine the nature of the attributes used to describe men, women and managers. Design/methodology/approach: Schein's Descriptive Index was used in this study. A total of 1,236 surveys were included in the study. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC, r1) were computed to determine the relationship between the different moderators and requisite managerial characteristics. Factorial analysis and agglomerative hierarchal cluster analysis were used to identify the traits attributed to men, women and managers. Findings: Male respondents continue to gender type the managerial role in favour of men. Both males and managers continue to be viewed as agentic in nature while women are viewed in more androgynous terms by both male and female respondents. Practical implications: This study expands our understanding of how males and females view women, men and managers. Based on the results of this study, the authors would argue that women are better equipped to adopt an androgynous leadership style and to practise transformational leadership. Originality/value: This study looks beyond ICC scores and looks at how each of the traits is linked to men, women and managers. The findings are discussed in terms of how organisations need to look beyond the misfit between women and requisite managerial characteristics and focus on what females can contribute at board level and to management in general. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - Vision is a central concept in charismatic/transformational leadership theory and has been shown to impact performance. However, empirical studies have coded vision statements in noncomparable ways. To measure the content of vision statements, the present study demonstrates the application of the motive coding methodology developed by McClelland and Winter. Using two independent samples of vision statements, we further demonstrate the applicability of this methodology by testing for expected relationships between vision statements and individual, unit, and organizational performance. Half of the expected relationships yielded significant results. Nevertheless, motive imagery measures yielded reliable scores, were feasible to apply, and provided relevant measures of vision statement content. This methodology has the potential to allow researchers to test charismatic/transformational leadership theory in new ways and to provide leaders with concrete guidance about the content of their vision statements. Considerations for future researchers and caveats are presented. © 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Purpose: Namibian principals are usually placed in leadership positions without orientation and are found to lack skills to supervise teachers in delivering instruction using the English language. Studies conducted elsewhere in the world found that effective school leadership is needed for the success of professional development programmes. The purpose of this paper is to explore principals’ lived experiences with regard to their roles in the implementation of the English Language Proficiency Programme (ELPP). Design/methodology/approach: This paper followed a qualitative inquiry with multiple case study designs to explore principals’ lived experiences during the implementation of the ELPP. Ten schools were selected for the analysis, two from each of the five regions. The schools were selected on the basis of remoteness, the total number of teachers who participated in the ELPP, school phases (i.e. primary and combined) and pre-test scores. Principals were interviewed using exploratory open-ended questions, and data analysis produced five categories under which the results were presented. Findings: The findings indicate that principals applied their individual logic to accommodate and implement the programme. They applied their individual productive leadership habitus to contextualise ELPP activities to ease their workload and appear corporative. Principals had significant influence on teacher learning and ensured successful implementation of a ministerial programme. Moreover, their leadership skills influenced the ways in which teachers received instruction and created a conducive learning environment. Owing to principals’ administrative, instructional and transformational leadership, many teachers participated and transcended upward and some were declared proficient in English. Research limitations/implications: This study research the effectiveness of leadership regarding English professional development programmes in achieving goals, explore power relations between school principals and education officials when developing and implementing professional development programmes and establish more efficient ways of providing a better leadership model for professional development programmes to achieve goals. Practical implications: This paper was limited to a few principals at rural schools in selected regions, therefore findings could not be generalised. Social implications: There is a need for creating opportunities for interactions among all stakeholders who are involved in the development and implementation of English proficiency programmes and to build power relations and work as a team to benefit schools. In order to enhance programme implementation and improve learning outcomes, there is also a need to provide feedback at intervals and find solutions to challenges as a team. Originality/value: Placing principals in situations without orientation triggered the need for specific leadership logic and particularities to be applied in a context for the success of the programme, which resulted in participation of more teachers in the ELPP. They applied their particularities and productive habitus through administrative, instructional and transformational leadership to enhance learning. Principals appointed English language teachers to instruct and mentor others, and consequently enabled some principals and teachers to exit the programme. Principals achieved these short wins upon realising that one has to cooperate with the authority to ensure achieving desired outcomes. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Purpose: The present study aims to examine whether an intervention designed to increase self-efficacy for transformational leadership results in more transformational leadership self-efficacy and a higher level of transformational leadership. In previous research higher levels of emotional intelligence have been found to be associated with more transformational leadership; thus the present study also seeks to examine whether higher emotional intelligence makes individuals more receptive to self-efficacy-based leadership training. Design/methodology/approach: The study used an experimental design. Participants were randomly assigned to either a self-efficacy expressive writing condition or a control writing condition. Participants were 118 managers who completed measures of self-efficacy, transformational leadership and emotional intelligence at the start of the study and again completed measures of self-efficacy, and transformational leadership after the intervention. Findings: Managers in the intervention condition showed significantly greater transformational leadership self-efficacy and higher transformational leadership scores than the control group managers at post-test. Further, those higher in emotional intelligence were more responsive to the intervention. Practical implications: The intervention holds promise as a low cost and easy to implement method of facilitating development of transformational leadership. Originality/value: The finding that an intervention aimed at increasing self-efficacy can increase transformational leadership extends previous research on both self-efficacy and transformational leadership. This result suggests that leadership self-efficacy may be an important component of transformational leadership. The finding that individuals higher in emotional intelligence benefited most from the intervention extends previous findings regarding the importance of emotional intelligence in organisational settings. Emotional intelligence may facilitate individuals' openness to change. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this study is to examine the differences in leadership styles prevalent in the public sector with those working in the banking and insurance industries. Cluster variables from both industries included in the analysis are as follows: Idealized influence, inspiring motivation, intellectual stimulation, and individualized consideration are all components of leadership. Theoretical Framework: Due to its apparent efficacy, transformational leadership has received a lot of attention from public sector researchers over the past decade. Successful leaders alter their teams by enlisting their followers' help in effecting change. A transformational leader is one who "transforms" their followers by inspiring them to make positive personal and professional shifts. Design / Methodology / Approach:The study is exploratory research design using Quantitative data collected from the Banking and Insurance sector employees. The study uses a well-structured questionnaire using Likert scale items. The sample was chosen on Convenience basis from 5 select public sector Insurance companies and 5 select public sector Insurance companies. 100 Questionnaires each were distributed and 97 valid responses were selected for banking industry and 90 responses from Insurance Industry were selected for the study. Paired t test using SPSS software was utilised for analysing the data in the study. Findings:The findings of the study show that there is significant difference between the leadership styles practices in Banking and Insurance industry. The banking sector employees showed a greater inclination towards transformational leadership with higher mean scores and statistically significant outcomes. Research Implications: Banking and insurance each have their own distinct cultures and management philosophies; as a result, they cannot be studied as a single entity under the umbrella of the BFSI sector. Additional research on the various leadership styles currently in use within the banking and insurance sectors is necessary. Originality/Value: There are no studies related comparative analysis between Insurance and Banking industry on the leadership styles in Public sector. © 2023 Spandidos Publications.

AB  - Purpose: The aim of this research was to test the assumption of differences between leadership styles adopted by leaders across generations, as perceived by their subordinates, on the premise that millennials hold different values from other generations, and that these values, in turn, have an impact on their leadership styles. Design/methodology/approach: This research was conducted in South Africa, in a variety of organisations, and by sampling employees across three generations, namely millennials, Generation X and baby boomers. Cross-sectional data were collected with an instrument based on the Pearce leadership typology of leadership styles. After confirming reliability and general factorial validity, mean scores were compared using analyses of variance. Findings/results: The results of the study found practically significant differences between millennial leaders and Generation X leaders in the extent to which they apply empowering and transformational leadership styles, as perceived by their subordinates. In absolute terms, millennial leaders display less leadership behaviour than do those of Generation X, with regard to these leadership approaches. Practical implications: Organisations involved in the development of millennial leaders should be aware that interventions should not blindly align to the stereotypes associated with this generation. Further research is also needed to determine which leadership styles are effective with millennial leaders. Originality/value: The millennial generation has emerged in the workplace as the new leadership pipeline, yet there appears to be a lack of research on how millennials want to lead. This study contributes to a nuanced understanding of and improved development of the millennial generation leaders. © 2023. The Authors.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of the paper was to survey transformational leadership traits in three academic libraries in the Gauteng province in South Africa. The three academic libraries were chosen based on the fact that two of the universities were residential research-intensive universities and the third was an academic library of a distance learning university. Design/methodology/approach: The study adopted a quantitative approach with a survey design in three academic libraries in the Gauteng province in South Africa in which a close-ended questionnaire yielded quantitative data. The study included 29 academic staff from the rank of assistant librarian to the director from the three academic libraries, as these are the personnel in leadership positions. To code and analyse, quantitative data from a Likert scale, SPSS version 25 was used. Cronbach's alpha was used to evaluate the instrument's reliability on the five constructs used in this study to determine readiness to adopt a transformational leadership style. The overall level of internal consistency exceeded the theoretical minimum of 70 percent. The Shapiro-Wilk test was used to determine the normality of the data and the p values were greater than 0.05 (p > 0.05). Tables have been used to present descriptive and inferential statistics based on data. Findings: Participants expressed favourable opinions about academic libraries' ability to learn from the best practices of others in the profession, with mean scores greater than 3.5 on a 5.0 scale. Participants' perceptions of transformative versus traditional management styles yielded a moderate mean score of 3.0, with moderate mean scores ranging from 2.8 to 3.3. The average score for talent identification and succession planning in academic libraries was 3.5. Perceptions of leadership responsibilities had a mean score of 4.1, with attributes on leadership responsibilities scoring at least 3.5. Perceptions of problems for the next generation of leaders in academic libraries were moderate, with a mean score of 3.2 on a scale of 5.0. Research limitations/implications: Only three of the seven public university libraries in the Gauteng province in South Africa were surveyed in this study. The sample size was reasonably small for generalizations beyond the South African Gauteng province academic libraries. However, it was felt useful for this particular case. A survey of all 26 South African public universities is required to assess transformational leadership traits in academic libraries. Practical implications: Next-generation leaders in South African academic libraries are perceived as not being aggressive in terms of team building, coaching and motivating others. Social implications: In the wake of COVID-19, new leadership traits such as scenario planning are needed for academic libraries. Originality/value: Leadership studies abound in the library and information studies (LIS) profession and they are not new. However, research on transformational leadership in South African libraries is still in its early stages. As a result, this study fills a gap in the literature on transformative leadership in academic libraries in South Africa. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Introduction Effective nursing leadership engenders staff retention, job satisfaction, commitment, work unit climate and client satisfaction with nursing services. This study assessed the perception of transformational leadership among nurses working in general hospitals in Nigeria. Materials and methods A cross-sectional study was conducted among 176 nurses in Ogun State, Nigeria. The independent student t-test was used to test the relationship between respondents’ characteristics and leadership behaviour scores. P value was set at 0.05. Results The average scores for 26 leadership behaviour items ranged from 3.28 to 4.21 out of a total of 5. The mean perception scores across the four nurse leadership behaviour domains ranged from 3.50 to 3.83. Nurses’ level of education was related to mean score of perception of leadership behaviour (p < 0.05). Conclusion Transformational leadership style is perceived by nurses to be utilized by Nurse Leaders. The perception of transformational leadership style depends on the work setting and nursing qualification. © 2017

AB  - Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to examine transformational and transactional leader behavior influence on the leader/follower dyad with respect to organizational commitment (OC) and satisfaction with leader in military setting. Design/methodology/approach – The research is quantitative, where multiple regressions assessed the hypothesized relationships between the transformational leadership, transactional leadership and laissez-faire leadership as the independent variables and the subordinates’ satisfaction with their leader, and organization commitment as the dependent variables. The sample studied includes 154 police members in two Middle East (ME) countries. Findings – The results indicated that there were positive linear relationship between some dimensions of transformational and transaction leadership and satisfaction with leadership. There was a negative linear relationship between laissez-faire leadership and satisfaction with leader. The leaders-outcome correlations showed higher scores between transformational leadership style and OC than between transactional leadership style and OC. Research limitations/implications – Because of the chosen research approach, the research results may lack generalizability on military institutions in other countries, and/or private institutions. Therefore, researchers are encouraged to test the proposed propositions further. The research includes implications for the development of a satisfaction with leaders, and development of organization commitment in military organizations in the ME. Originality/value – This research fulfills an identified need to study how military organization commitment can be enabled in ME countries. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - Background High-quality patient care requires nurses with strong clinical competency. Thus, it is essential to examine the factors associated with clinical competency. Purpose This study was designed to (a) investigate head nurse leadership, staff nurse demographics, and clinical competency; (b) examine the impact of demographics on the clinical competency of staff nurses; (c) analyze the correlation between head nurse leadership and staff nurse clinical competency; and (d) examine the effects of demographics on clinical competency after controlling for the head nurse leadership. Methods A cluster sampling method was used to collect data from 200 staff nurses at a national medical center in Taiwan. Questionnaires were used to gather information on head nurse leadership style and staff nurse clinical competency. Descriptive and inferential statistical analyses were conducted, including Mann-Whitney U test, Kruskal-Wallis test, Spearman's rank correlation coefficient, and multivariate analysis of covariance. Results The average score for transformational leadership style among the head nurses was 2.89, whereas transactional leadership style scored an average of 2.49. The average scores for the components of clinical competency, listed from highest to lowest, were as follows: patient care (3.35), professionalism (3.28), communication skills (3.18), management (2.84), and knowledge (2.73). In addition, statistically significant differences were found in clinical competency based on demographic factors, including age, marital status, educational level, job title, and length of employment. Also, a statistically significant, positive correlation between the head nurse transformational leadership style and nurse clinical competency was found. The main effect of length of employment on the five competency components was statistically significant after controlling for transformational leadership. Furthermore, post hoc analysis of covariance revealed a significant effect of length of employment on patient care, knowledge, communication skills, and management. Conclusions The findings of this study indicate transformational leadership and employment length impact the clinical competency of staff nurses, particularly in terms of patient care, communication skills, management, and knowledge. Providing education and training in leadership and management to current and prospective head nurses may be expected to enhance clinical competency in staff nurses and create a more nurturing work environment. Moreover, targeted training may help current head nurses gain insight into their leadership styles and acquire skills to promote transformational leadership. In addition, leadership development may help equip prospective head nurses with critical competencies before assuming leadership responsibilities.  © Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

AB  - Studies have shown that transformational leadership favours innovation, change and involvement towards improvement and problem solving, generating an atmosphere of respect and tolerance, it is considered ideal leadership in the educational sphere. Furthermore, socio-emotional and moral competences are essential for school leaders and teachers. However, there is a gap about what kind of socioemotional and moral competences can be related to a transformational leadership style in future teachers and that could be relevant information for university education, which is the purpose of this research. For this ex post facto quantitative survey research, a sample of 395 prospective teachers (81.3% female and 18.7% male) between 17 and 63 years of age (M = 21.08; SD = 3.49) was used. Statistical analyses included Student’s t-test and linear regressions. Results showed high scores in transformational leadership and a high degree of social-emotional and moral competencies. Significant gender differences were found, with girls having higher scores. Relationships were found between self-management and motivation, social awareness and prosocial behaviour, responsible decision-making and moral emotions with transformational leadership. The practical implications of these findings are discussed and concluded by pointing out the importance of working on and promoting. © 2023. Psy, Soc & Educ.

AB  - The main objective of this research is to explain the high school principal's relationship between transformational leadership with psychological empowerment. This is a descriptive and correlational study which was carried out on 103 principals of high school (51 females and 52 males). Sampling method included stratified sampling proportional to the size and simple random sampling. To collect the data, Bass and Avolio's Transformational Leadership and principal's psychological empowerment of Spreitzer were used. Analysis of survey data was done by calculating frequencies, percentages, means, standard deviations, correlation coefficient test and stepwise regression coefficient test. The results showed that among a series of seven transformational leadership factors except for leadership that is based on non-interference which is used at an average level, the principals use other factors including: inspirational motivation, idealized influence, intellectual stimulation, contingent reward, personal considerations and management by exception at a high level, respectively. In the case of psychological empowerment variable, the mean scores of principals at all dimensions were placed in the range of high. In this regard, the dimensions of meaning and concept, ability, job satisfaction, the selection and effect obtained the highest mean, respectively. The results also showed that there was a relatively significant positive relationship between idealized influence and inspirational motivation factors of transformational leadership and all aspects of psychological empowerment. In general, there was a significant relationship between the two variables (r = 0.382). Regression test showed that the two factors of inspirational motivation and idealized influence together could predict 23.4% of changes in the psychological empowerment of principals. © Medwell Journals, 2016.

AB  - The assumption of Confucian traditions being a handicap for East Asians when adapting to a modernizing world has been subject to challenge because of the rapid development of East Asian societies, which has prompted researchers to seek a culturally compatible perspective for understanding the foundations of East Asian modernization. This paper built a hypothetical model for indigenous theoretical resources. In The Analects, Confucius offered propositions on the links between leaders' Junzi personality (i.e., Confucian ideal personality traits) and leadership effectiveness, as well as the mediating roles of leadership styles. To test our hypotheses, we conducted two studies involving 513 supervisor–subordinate dyads in China. Study 1 indicated that Junzi personality had a significantly positive effect on leadership effectiveness and that such significance remained even after controlling for the Big Five personality traits. It also examined the incremental value and relative importance. Study 2 showed that ethical and transformational leadership mediated the effect of Junzi personality on leadership effectiveness measured two months later. In both datasets, leaders with higher Junzi personality scores assigned higher self-ratings on performance, and their subordinates perceived higher leadership effectiveness, felt higher job satisfaction, and displayed lower turnover intentions. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Guided by gaps in the literature with regard to the study of politicians the aim of the research is to explore cross-cultural differences in political leaders’ style. It compares the MLQ (Avolio & Bass, 2004) scores of elected political leaders (N = 140) in Bulgaria and the UK. The statistical exploration of the data relied on multivariate analyses of covariance. The findings of comparisons across the two groups reveal that compared to British political leaders, Bulgarian leaders were more likely to frequently use both transactional and passive/avoidant behaviours. The study tests Bass’s (1997) strong assertion about the universality of transformational leadership. It contributes to the leadership literature by providing directly measured data relating to the behaviours of political leaders. Such information on the characteristics of politicians could allow for more directional hypotheses in subsequent research, exploring the contextual influences within transformational leadership theory. The outcomes might also aid applied fields. Knowledge gained of culturally different leaders could be welcomed by multicultural political and economic unions, wherein understanding and allowances might aid communication. © 2017, PsychOpen.

AB  - Background: Despite China’s 1.4 billion population and massive investment in improving medical education, there is no transformational national or international course focused on emergency trauma care. In order to overcome recognized deficiencies, we developed an affordable knowledge and skills workshop called Essential Trauma Critical Care China (ETCCC). Methods: Pre-course and post-course MCQs were used to test knowledge and simulation scenarios quantified clinical competence. Structured feedback was obtained. To evaluate the effect of ETCCC on staff performance, we analyzed the clinical records and questioned resuscitation team peers for trauma patients requiring resuscitation room intervention in the 10 consecutive patients before and after the workshops. Results: During 2022–2023, five workshops were delivered to participants from six hospitals in two Chinese provinces. Cost per participant did not exceed US$125. Fifty-eight doctors and 37 nurses participated. For all delegates pre-course knowledge scores increased from mean 35% to 70% post-course. 99% (n = 82/83) participants reached the required standard in the post-course written test. Post-course skills tests scores were mean 67% for doctors and 84% for nurses. Nurses demonstrated significant improvements in the rate and quality of trauma history acquisition as well as triage skills after the course (all p < 0.01). Doctors scored significant improvement in the areas of leadership and teamwork, care of cervical spine, circulation assessment and fluid resuscitation (all p < 0.02). Conclusion: Essential Trauma Critical Care China (ETCCC) is the first economically developed medical educational tool shown to improve performance of emergency room staff. Its success may have relevance for trauma-care education in similar medium-resource environments. © 2024 by author(s).

AB  - This research sought to identify leadership styles of enterprise managers in four countries of the former USSR. The survey was based on the Bass and Avolio MLQ5x leadership styles instrument. Valid responses were received from 2,391 managers and employees at nine manufacturing enterprises located in Russia, Georgia, Kazakhstan and the Kyrgyz Republic. The results suggest that managers in these four countries used three well-known leadership styles – transactional, transformational, and laissez-faire. However, the laissez-faire style was not prevalent. Overall, transactional contingent reward leadership was used more often than any other approaches. Charisma and individualized consideration received the lowest scores among the transformational leadership style dimensions. Tests of the relationship between leadership styles and managerial performance measures indicated that contingent reward and charisma had the strongest relationship with positive outcomes. Individual country leadership style profiles and implications for developing leadership training programs, and for the transfer of Western organization development approaches are discussed. © 2001, MCB UP Limited

AB  - Relationships between motivation and transformational leadership were examined in this study. 56 leaders and 234 followers from a variety of organizations were sampled. Leaders were administered the Motivation Sources Inventory and the Job Choice Decision-making Exercise, while followers reported leaders' behaviors using the Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire (MLQ-rater version). Scores on the Motivation Sources Inventory subscales subsequently correlated with the Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire subscales of inspirational motivation, idealized influence (behavior), and individualized consideration (range, r = .13 to .23). There were no significant correlations among any of the Job Choice Decision-making Exercise subscales with any of the variables measured.

AB  - Theories of constructive and moral development are proposed by Kuhnert and Lewis (1987), Kegan and Lahey (1984), Fisher and Torbert (1991), Palus and Drath (1995) and others as models for providing clarification and extension of how cognitive and personality differences within individuals influence leadership effectiveness. Using interviewing methods based on Constructive-developmental (CD) theory (Kegan, 1982), a sample of 32 cadets at a military institute were measured for their level of CD development and subsequent performance on an assortment of measures. CD development correlated significantly with scores on the Defining Issues Test (DIT) of moral development, peer ratings from fellow cadets, and summarized performance across a variety of military and extracurricular activities. Implications highlight the utility of incorporating a developmental perspective in the study of leadership.

AB  - Aims: This pilot study evaluated an Association Development and Professional Transformation (ADAPT) model for nursing leadership development and assessed satisfaction with the ADAPT workshop. Background: Nurses often lack self-confidence and self-efficacy in leadership roles. There is a need for nurses to take leadership opportunities that serve to advance the nursing profession. Methods: A quasi-experimental pre-test post-test design was used. The sampling method selected professional nursing association (PNA) members. Novice participants completed a pre-assessment and post-assessment Leadership Practice Inventory-Self (LPI-S) survey and attended the ADAPT workshop. Experienced nurse leaders participated as mentors. Both groups completed a satisfaction survey after the workshop. Results: Awareness of nursing leadership behaviours increased. Total mean scores for each subscale on the LPI-S increased but this was not statistically significant. All participants reported satisfaction with the ADAPT workshop. Conclusions: This study offers evidence that the ADAPT model influences leadership behaviours. The ADAPT workshop provided a method to gain a leadership perspective and to encourage nurses to fulfil a leadership role within professional nursing associations. Implications for Nursing Management: Organisations and professional nursing associations that support the leadership potential of nurses must invest in providing leadership development opportunities. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - This study aimed at determining the relationship between leadership and the work engagement of nurses. This descriptive-correlational study was designed with 325 purposive nurse samples from participating three selected Philippine institutional provinces collected between March and June 2020 using Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire (MLQ) and Utrecht Work Engagement Scale (UWES) instruments. Mainly perceived as having moderate level transformational (216 or 66.5%), transactional (214 or 65.8%), and passive-avoidant (227 or 69.8%) leadership, nurses were specifically regarded as highly inspirational motivators (score=8.22; SD+1.873) and content with standard performance (management-by-exception, score=8.09; SD+1.995) than being passive-avoidant (score=7.02; SD+1.916). Using IBM SPSS v.26, the study utilized a chi-square test of association which found out that all three nurses’ leadership styles and their factors were statistically significant with their overall work engagement (p=.000) and its domains namely, vigor (p=.000), dedication (p=.000), and absorption (p=.000) with moderate-, relatively strong-, and strong associations. Nurses’ multifactorial leadership and work engagement were suggestive interrelated characteristics that demonstrate an increasing level of leadership congruent with a higher level of work engagement. Hence, this study offers a remarkable hypothetical underpinning nurses’ opportunity to assume leadership roles and functions to improve their overall work engagement. © 2022 The Authors.

AB  - Purpose: Healthcare organizations face challenges in balancing efficiency and innovation, known as ambidexterity. Leadership plays an important role, with transformational leadership driving innovation and transactional leadership supporting efficiency. The dominant leadership framework is the Full-Range Leadership Theory (FRLT), which identifies three leadership behaviors: transforma-tional, transactional, and passive avoidant. Organizational structures, following Mintzberg, Pugh and Galbraith, including span of control (SoC), unit grouping, and lateral linkages, significantly influence leadership dynamics. This study examines the impact of structural changes on perceived leadership styles in a Dutch radiotherapy center (RTc) following the implementation of proton therapy, a radical innovation. Patients and Methods: A mixed-method approach combined leadership surveys, with data collected at three time points, before and after structural changes in 2022. The multifactor leadership questionnaire (MLQ) was distributed among the employees in November 2021, March 2022, and March 2023. Three interventions were introduced: (1) appointing dedicated team leaders (TLs) to improve information flow and reduce management SoC; (2) integrating a Patient Care (PC) manager into the advisory board to facilitate direct communication within the governance structure, including other hierarchical layers; and (3) adding a proton therapy manager as a liaison to improve coordination. Leadership perceptions were measured using the Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire (MLQ) at three time points (T1, T2, T3). The Independent-Samples Mann–Whitney U-Test (p<0.05), was used to compare T1, T2, and T3, managers’ self-ratings with employee ratings, and scores between photon and proton treatment employees. Results: Transformational leadership significantly increased across all groups, with PC scores rising from 2.3 at T1/T2 to 2.5 at T3, and MT-PC scores from 1.8 at T1 to 2.4 at T3. Passive avoidant leadership significantly decreased (eg, MT-PC: 1.6 at T1 to 1.0 at T3). Transactional leadership showed less pronounced and non-significant changes. Photon therapy staff experienced earlier improvements in leadership perceptions, while proton therapy staff showed delayed but stronger shifts by T3. Conclusion: In this study, structural changes positively influenced leadership perceptions, supporting ambidexterity. Significant increases in transformational leadership and decreases in passive avoidant leadership align leadership styles with the dual demands of innovation and operational efficiency, demonstrating the importance of organizational design in healthcare leadership. Our findings show that healthcare management could use organizational structure changes to promote transformational leadership. © 2025 Swart et al.

AB  - This study aimed to describe nurses’ evaluations of their work engagement, their perceptions of their managers’ transformational leadership, and the relationships between these factors. A cross-sectional study design was employed. The Transformational Leadership Scale was used to measure the transformational leadership qualities of nurse managers. The Utrecht Work Engagement Scale (UWES-9) was used to measure nurses’ work engagement. The data were analyzed using statistical tests, the Pearson correlation coefficient, and linear regression analysis. Among the work engagement subscales, nurses scored highest on dedication to work (mean 4.14, SD 1.22) and lowest on vigor (mean 3.68, SD 1.9). For transformational leadership subscales, giving feedback and rewards received the lowest scores (mean of 2.64, SD 1.02), while management of the nursing process scored the highest (mean 3.25, SD 0.92). The correlation between transformational leadership and work engagement was statistically significant (r = 0.367, p < 0.001). In conclusion, transformational leadership by nurse managers may increase nurses’ work engagement. Nurse managers can develop and incorporate transformational leadership traits through training programs. Further research is needed to understand the mechanisms linking transformational leadership to nurses’ work engagement. Copyright © 2025 Anu Nurmeksela et al.

AB  - The role of corporate psychopathic traits in supervisors on employee attitudes has yet to be studied. The goal of the present study is to test the impact of corporate psychopathy in leaders on their employee's attitudes and its impact above and beyond the influence of leadership styles associated with the Full-Range Leadership Model (Transformational, Transactional and Laissez-Faire leadership). A total of 74 supervisors and 423 subordinates participated in this study. Employees completed self-report measures of job satisfaction, turnover intentions, work motivation and job neglect. They also rated their immediate supervisor on the Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire and the B-Scan 360 (a corporate psychopathy measure). Hierarchical linear regressions indicated that the B-Scan 360 total score was the best predictor of employee's job satisfaction, turnover intentions, work motivation and job neglect (beyond the influence of the Full Range leadership Model). These results indicate that, for our sample, the B-Scan 360 is a stronger predictor of employee attitudes than the three leadership styles comprising the Full-Range Leadership Model. These results represent a stepping stone for future research trying to unravel the factors associated with dark leadership and its impact on employee attitudes. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Background Information and Significance: Critical thinking (CT) skills and the inclination to engage in critical thinking are essential for nurse managers to function as transformational leaders capable of influencing staff to align with organizational goals. In an extensive literature review, numerous studies were found examining the concept of CT in students and no studies were found exploring CT in nurse managers. Identifying the attributes, such as CT, that lead to success in the nurse manager role is useful when preparing nurse managers to lead effectively in the current healthcare climate. Research Question: Is there a difference between nurse managers' CT dispositions and their respective staff nurses' perceptions of the practice environment?. Design: A convenience sample of 12 nurse managers and a random sample of 132 of their respective staff registered nurses (RNs) participated in this descriptive study. CT in nurse managers was measured by the California Critical Thinking Disposition Inventory (CCTDI). Staff RNs' perceptions of the practice environment were measured by the Practice Environment Scale (PES). The research question was answered using a t test. Findings: Significant (p < .001) differences were found between specific nurse managers' CCTDI scores for open-mindedness, analyticity, and critical thinking confidence, and significant differences (p < .01) were found for systematicity when compared with their respective staff RNs' mean subscale and overall PES scores. Conclusions: Results of the study support the positive relationship between strength in critical thinking dispositions of nurse managers and their respective staff RNs' perceptions of the practice environment. Nurse managers with stronger CT dispositions may be better able to create positive practice environments that are conducive to job satisfaction and thus the retention of staff RNs. Inclusion of strategies to support the development and use of CT in nurse managers is recommended. CT and other leadership attributes and skills including emotional and social intelligence and management of change through an appreciative inquiry process may provide opportunities to improve leadership effectiveness in nurse managers. Clinical Relevance: Enhancing critical thinking skills and dispositions of nurse managers may help to create positive work environments for staff RNs. Staff RNs who work in an environment perceived to be positive may be in a better position to deliver high quality, safe patient care. © 2010 Sigma Theta Tau International.

AB  - Transformational leadership based interventions were assessed using a pre-test, post-test, and control group design. Leaders (N=54) from 21 long-term health care organizations were randomly assigned to general transformational leadership training, safety-specific transformational leadership training, or a control group. Multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) showed that leadership training resulted in significant effects on manager post-training ratings of safety attitudes, intent to promote safety, and self-efficacy. The effects of leadership training on employee (N=115) perceptions of leader safety-specific transformational leadership, safety climate, safety participation, safety compliance, safety-related events and, injuries were also assessed. Multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA), with the pre-test scores as the covariates, showed that leadership training resulted in significant effects on the safety-specific transformational leadership and safety climate outcomes. © 2009 The British Psychological Society.

AB  - Purpose - This paper analyses the opinions of the Botswana National Library Service's (BNLS) Headquarters (HQ) staff and staff of the Botswana public libraries on strategic human resource management issues, which were tested by six hypotheses. Design/methodology/approach - The analysis was carried out by statistical means. The t-test was the method used for comparing the two groups' mean scores. Analyses were repeated using the Chi-squared test. Findings - The study identified a number of issues where staff had differences of opinion: Changing employees' expectations about work, transformational leadership, job satisfaction, performance feedback and delegation of responsibility. The paper briefly discusses the issues where the status of the library influenced staff opinions. Research limitations/implications - It is to be noted that the data collected from HQ has to be used with caution because the number of respondents there was smaller than the respondents from public libraries. Practical implications - The author throws light on human resource management techniques in the everyday library environment. This paper may help policy makers to identify ways in which they can motivate their employees; it may help policy planners to identify their staff's different requirements. Originality/value - This paper provides a useful and insightful application of a general human resource management tool to the specific organizational context of public libraries. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - The concept of emotional intelligence and its connections with other important psychological constructs have been the focus of a wide range of current research (see Mestre & Fernández-Berrocal, 2007, and Salovey, Woolery, & Mayer, 2001, for reviews). Yet the relationship between emotional intelligence and transformational leadership, a leadership style that is highly correlated with efficiency and satisfaction of the leaders' followers, has scarcely been analyzed. We hypothesize that individuals who score high in emotional intelligence emerge as leaders more easily than low-emotional-intelligence individuals due to the fact that they are more transformational in their leadership style. We further suggest that this is especially the case in highly cohesive groups. In this study, we test these ideas and find empirical support for our hypotheses. © 2008 University of Phoenix.

AB  - Background: Job satisfaction is an important factor in the retention of nurses. There are a few valid and reliable scales to evaluate job satisfaction for nurses in Turkey. Objectives: This methodological study was performed to determine whether the Turkish version of the "McCloskey and Mueller Job Satisfaction Scale/MMSS" is a valid and reliable tool for nurses in Turkey. Methods: This study was conducted with 324 nurses in three hospitals in Istanbul between June and August 2017. The study data collected using the "Descriptive Characteristics Form", and "McCloskey and Mueller Job Satisfaction Scale" consisting of 31 items. Results: The scale content validity index was 0.93. The Cronbach's alpha reliability coefficient was 0.81 for the overall scale and ranged from 0.45 to 0.70 for the sub-dimensions. The stability of the scale over time was tested with 32 nurses twice at a 15-day interval. There was no significant difference between the two measurements. The item-total score reliability coefficient of the scale ranged between 0.28 and 0.49. In the confirmatory factor analysis, the path coefficients of the items with their dimension (eight sub-dimensions) ranged between 0.36 and 0.64. The goodness of fit of the model determined in the confirmatory factor analysis was at an acceptable level (Chi square / Degree of freedom: 1.4, p < .05). Conclusion: The results of this study indicated that MMSS meets the content and construct validity criteria. Although reliability tests of the MMSS, which are item analysis and stability, are acceptable range there is a need for further research to test the reliability of Cronbach alpha on the subdimensions of the MMSS. © 2020, Dokuz Eylul University.

AB  - Objectives: The objective of the present study was to validate a shortened transformational leadership (TL) scale (12 items) comprising core TL behaviour and to test the associations of this shortened TL scale with depressive symptoms. Methods: The study used cross-sectional data from 1632 employees of the overall workforce of a middle-sized German company (51.6% men; mean age, 41.35 years; standard deviation, 9.4 years). TL was assessed with the German version of the Transformational Leadership Inventory and depressive symptoms with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). The structural validity of the core TL scale was assessed with confirmatory factor analysis. Associations with depressive symptoms were estimated with structural equation modelling and adjusted logistic regression. Results: Confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modelling showed better model fit for the core TL than for the full TL score. Logistic regression revealed 3.61-fold (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.20 to 5.93: women) to 4.46-fold (95% CI, 2.86 to 6.95: men) increased odds of reporting depressive symptoms (HADS score >8) for those in the lowest tertile of reported core TL. Conclusions: The shortened core TL seems to be a valid instrument for research and training purposes in the context of TL and depressive symptoms in employees. Of particular note, men reporting poor TL were more likely to report depressive symptoms. Copyright © 2019 The Korean Society for Preventive Medicine

AB  - Leaders in e-commerce businesses face significant complexity and uncertainty in virtual work environments. However, research on the measurement of leadership development in a virtual work environment for leaders in e-commerce businesses in Thailand is limited. Thus, the main purposes of this study were to examine the dimensions and to develop the scale of virtual transformational leadership for leaders in e-commerce businesses and test its psychometric properties. A multi-methods design was implemented to examine the dimensions and develop the virtual transformational leadership scale for leaders in e-commerce businesses. Firstly, the integration of virtual leadership and transformational leadership behaviors and interviewed with five e-commerce experts were conducted to synthesize the virtual transformational leadership dimensions for leaders in e-commerce businesses. The final 33-item scale of virtual transformational leadership for leaders in e-commerce businesses was generated and distributed as a second result. Data was collected using an online questionnaire, and the instruments used were Likert-type scales. The participants were 600 leaders in e-commerce businesses in Bangkok. The goodness-of-fit indices showed that the virtual transformational leadership model was consistent with the empirical data (Chi-square = 2314.71, df = 585, p-value = .00, RMSEA = .07, SRMR = .04, NFI = .97) with a Cronbach’s alpha score of .96. This study contributes to behavioral science research by developing a virtual transformational leadership scale that measures virtual transformational leadership behaviors for leaders in e-commerce businesses in the Thai context. © 2023, Behavioral Science Research Institute.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to report on the implementation of the World Health Organization (WHO) trauma care checklist (TCC) (WHO, 2016) in an emergency department in a tertiary hospital in Nepal. This research was undertaken as part of a Hybrid International Emergency Medicine Fellowship programme (Subedi et al., 2020) across UK and Nepal, incorporating a two-year rotation through the UK National Health Service, via the Medical Training Initiative (MTI) (AoMRC, 2017). The WHO TCC can improve outcomes for trauma patients (Lashoher et al., 2016); however, significant barriers affect its implementation worldwide (Nolan et al., 2014; Wild et al., 2020). This article reports on the implementation, barriers and recommendations of WHO TCC implementation in the context of Nepal and argues for Transformational Leadership (TL) to support its implementation. Design/methodology/approach: Explanatory mixed methods research (Creswell, 2014), comprising quasi-experimental research and a qualitative online survey, were selected methods for this research. A training module was designed and implemented for 10 doctors and 15 nurses from a total of 76 (33%) of clinicians to aid in the introduction of the WHO TCC in an emergency department in a hospital in Nepal. The quasi-experimental research involved a pre- and post-training survey aimed to assess participant’s knowledge of the WHO TCC before and after training and before the implementation of the WHO TCC in the emergency department. Post-training, 219 patients were reviewed after four weeks to identify if process measures had improved the quality of care to trauma patients. Subsequently six months later, a qualitative online survey was sent to all clinical staff in the department to identify barriers to implementation, with a response rate of 26 (n = 26) (34%) (20 doctors and 6 nurses). Descriptive statistics were used to evaluate quantitative data and the qualitative data were analysed using the five stepped approach of thematic analysis (Braun and Clarke, 2006). Findings: The evaluation of the implementation of the WHO TCC showed an improvement in care for trauma patients in an emergency setting in a tertiary hospital in Nepal. There were improvements in the documentation in trauma management, showing the training had a direct impact on the quality of care of trauma patients. Notably, there was an improvement in cervical spine examination from 56.1% before training to 78.1%; chest examination 125 (57.07%) before training and 170 (77.62%) post-training; abdominal examination 121 (55.25%) before training and 169 (77.16%) post-training; gross motor examination 13 (5.93%) before training and 131 (59.82%) post-training; sensory examination 4 (1.82%) before training and 115 (52.51%) post-training; distal pulse examination 6 (2.73%) before training and 122 (55.7%) post-training. However, while the quality of documentation for trauma patients improved from the baseline of 56%, it only reached 78% when the percentage improvement target agreed for this research project was 90%. The 10 (n = 10) doctors and 15 (n = 15) nurses in the Emergency Department (ED) all improved their baseline knowledge from 72.2% to 87% (p = 0.00006), by 14.8% and 67% to 85%) (p = 0.006), respectively. Nurses started with lower scores (mean 67) in the baseline when compared to doctors, but they made significant gains in their learning post-training. The qualitative data reported barriers, such as the busyness of the department, with residents and medical officers, suggesting a shortened version of the checklist to support greater protocol compliance. Embedding this research within TL provided a steer for successful innovation and change, identifying action for sustaining change over time. Research limitations/implications: The study is a single-centre study that involved trauma patients in an emergency department in one hospital in Nepal. There is a lack of internationally recognised trauma training in Nepal and very few specialist trauma centres; hence, it was challenging to teach trauma to clinicians in a single 1-h session. High levels of transformation of health services are required in Nepal, but the sample for this research was small to test out and pilot the protocol to gain wider stakeholder buy in. The rapid turnover of doctors and nurses in the emergency department, creates an additional challenge but encouraging a multi-disciplinary approach through TL creates a greater chance of sustainability of the WHO TCC. Practical implications: International protocols are required in Nepal to support the transformation of health care. This explanatory mixed methods research, which is part of an International Fellowship programme, provides evidence of direct improvements in the quality of patient care and demonstrates how TL can drive improvement in a low- to medium-income country. Social implications: The Nepal/UK Hybrid International Emergency Medicine Fellowships have an opportunity to implement changes to the health system in Nepal through research, by bringing international level standards and protocols to the hospital to improve the quality of care provided to patients. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this research paper is one of the first studies of its kind to demonstrate direct patient level improvements as an outcome of the two-year MTI scheme. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - OBJECTIVE The translation and cross-cultural adaptation of the “Global Transformational Leadership scale” into Greek. METHOD The original questionnaire was in English and the target version was in Greek. The process of translation into Greek was applied and then the translation of the Greek version into English, and finally the translation and cross-cultural adaptation process was checked. To test the reliability of the questionnaire, a test-retest study was conducted. Confirmatory factor analysis was performed to check validity. RESULTS The kappa indices in initial measurement and re-measurement for the seven questions of “Global Transformational Leadership scale” were found to have statistically significant relationships, indicating high reliability of the questionnaire. Furthermore, the high reliability of the questionnaire is also indicated by the fact that the intraclass correlation coefficient for the total score was extremely high and, more specifically, equal to 0.95 (95% confidence interval: 0.89 to 0.98, p<0.001). According to the results of the confirmatory factor analysis, the Greek version of the “Global Transformational Leadership scale” showed excellent fit, as all indicators had acceptable values. Moreover, the weighted regression weights had high values as they ranged from 0.74 to 0.89. Thus, it can be concluded that “Global Transformational Leadership scale” has high construct validity and is unidimensional. CONCLUSIONS The Greek version of the “Global Transformational Leadership scale” has high reliability and validity and is a valid tool to assess the transformational leadership style of those in positions of responsibility. © 2024, BETA Medical Publishers Ltd.

AB  - In the present study, the direct effect of principal transformational leadership to school staff turnover and school performance was examined, in addition to its indirect effect through school staff job satisfaction. Survey data were obtained from elementary school staff and students, and school-aggregated student achievement test scores were obtained from school archives. Results showed that staff reports of principal behaviors could be described in terms of the three components of transformational leadership: inspiration or charisma, individualized consideration, and intellectual stimulation. Principal transformational leadership was not associated directly with either school staff turnover or school-aggregated student achievement progress. Rather, principal transformational leadership showed an indirect effect, through staff job satisfaction, on school staff turnover (negative) and on school-aggregated student achievement progress (positive). Finally, higher levels of school staff job satisfaction were associated with smaller achievement gaps between minority and non-minority students. This result was more evident among schools having higher levels of principal transformational leadership. Results are discussed in relation to the role of transformational leadership in school performance and in recruiting, training, and evaluating school principals. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - Managerial coaching is currently seen as an effective leadership practice facilitating learning process of the employees for performing better and being more effective in organizations. This article builds on recent research on the importance of the managerial coaching by empirically investigating the effects of a cognitive-behavioral coaching programme over mid-level managers. Due to the similarities between managerial coaching behaviors and transformational leadership behaviors, we have adopted the transformational leadership model as theoretical framework for evaluating management behaviors. The study used a pre-posttest approach to test the effects of the coaching program especially designed for 23 mid-level managers having as responsibility the supervision of production teams in a multinational organization. The major aims of the program consisted of: developing managerial coaching skills, assertive communication skills, motivation of subordinates. Overall, the analysis of results elicited an increase of scores in the leadership behavior dimensions measured by multifactor leadership questionnaire that are part of the managerial coaching skills. Besides, the effectiveness perceived as an indicator of performance was significantly higher upon completion of the coaching program. Findings suggest that coaching, as a professional development method, has great potential to contribute to the managerial behaviors that facilitate development at subordinate level, as they are captured by some transformational and transactional scales. Such knowledge can be informative for practitioners as well in developing effective managers and leaders and understanding and managing employee attitudes and behaviors in organizations. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - Background: Coaching is a recognised method of leadership development which is utilised for leaders in many organisations but is less so with clinical leaders in healthcare. Coaching has demonstrated potential in leadership development with high returns on investment. This could be transferred to healthcare and may be of benefit in improving quality of care cost-effectively. This would require long-term changes to develop a coaching culture in healthcare. Aim: The aim of this study is to understand the views of clinicians on leadership roles and the use of coaching as a development tool. Method: The study was questionnaire-based with ethical approval from the organisation where the study was done. The study had both qualitative and quantitative elements. Analysis of quantitative measures was done by Chi square test. P = 0.05 regarded as significant. The views on key aspects of leadership were coded against the medical leadership competency framework. Results: Forty questionnaires were sent out and 22 returned (55% response rate). Most of the respondents were in post for at least 10 years and viewed their clinical role as leadership. Significantly more respondents were in post for longer than 10 years and those in post under 10 years were significantly more likely to consider other training tools apart from coaching. The majority rated their leadership at six or higher on a scale of 1-10. Fifty-nine percent had training in leadership and this is reflected in low scores on the need for further training, although most would accept training and that it has a role in leadership development. Regarding leadership roles, respondents' views were coded to the medical leadership competency framework with setting direction having the highest match (30%). The views also had aspects of charismatic and transformational leadership styles. Coaching was felt to be a useful tool in developing leadership although there were some concerns in ensuring confidentiality and match between coach and coached. Most would consider use of a coach but expressed as a whole the view that the coach should be experienced, from outside the organisation and have a healthcare background. Conclusions and recommendations: The study indicates that training in leadership for development is supported by clinicians in leadership roles and that there is support for coaching as a developmental tool with a preference for external coaches with a healthcare background. This appears to be primarily due to seniority of clinicians and concerns around confidentiality and independence. Further work should be explored to promote a coaching culture amongst clinicians. © 2012 Radcliffe Publishing.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Leadership is a wide concept that is rapidly developing. Diverse theories suggest different styles of leadership, with strong relationships between the different styles and their outcomes. The transformational style emphasizes motivating employees and encouraging them to find new ways of dealing with issues. The transactional (TL) style promotes ideas of rewards and punishments. The Laissez-faire style is characterized by relaxation and the tendency to leave things to happen with minimal interference. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a descriptive cross-sectional study design conducted in Primary Healthcare Centers in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. The leadership styles were assessed using a Multi-Factor Leadership Questionnaire, which identifies the different styles of leadership. SPSS v 26.0 was used for data analysis. t-test employed to compare leadership style between raters and managers. Logistics regression model used to determine the influence of leadership styles of managers. Pearson correlation coefficient determined the linear relationship between leadership styles and its domains. RESULTS: A total of 130 respondents (65 managers vs. 65 raters) took part. 'Raters' refer to any persons other than the manager, such as a secretary, nurse, doctor. The 'manager' is when the person rates himself. The global transformation mean score was 3.55, for TL it was 3.42 and for passive avoidant, the mean score was 0.93. The passive avoidant (t = 2.005; P = 0.047) and management by exception (passive) (MBEP) mean scores of raters were statistically significantly higher than managers. In the binary regression model, MBEP was the independent significant predictor of manager. CONCLUSION: The perceived leadership style of Primary Healthcare Center managers was transformational but with TL. Transformational leadership was positively correlated with TL leadership but negatively correlated with passive avoidant (The Laissez-faire style). The outcome of this study demonstrated that intellectual stimulation, idealized attributes, and inspirational motivation are perhaps better than contingent reward, active management. © 2022 Journal of Family and Community Medicine | Published by Wolters Kluwer-Medknow.

AB  - Introduction: Leadership is crucial in all professions and organisations, including the oral health profession. Objectives: The aims of this analytical cross-sectional study were to evaluate the self-reported leadership behaviours and the factors influencing leadership behaviours among dentists who were heads of dental departments in community hospitals, southern Thailand. Materials and methods: The self-administered questionnaire was composed of four parts: personal data; a 45-item Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire version 5× short (MLQ 5× short); a 34-item organisational climate perception; and a 52-item emotional intelligence screening test. Results: Of 134 dentists, 133 returned the questionnaire, providing a 99.3% response rate. The scores on the transactional component had a mean score of 2.98 (SD = 0.46). The transformational scores ranged with a mean of 2.90 (SD = 0.49). The scores of the passive leadership component had the lowest results, with a mean of 1.21 (SD = 0.57). Afterwards, the highest score for each head of the dental department was examined and compared across the three components. Approximately 60% of the dentists fell on the transactional, 34.6% on the transformational and 2.3% on the passive–avoidant scale. Multiple linear regression showed that the factors influencing the leadership of the dentists included emotional intelligence, the professional position of the dentists and the perception of the organisational climate. Conclusions: The majority of heads of dental departments had transactional leadership style followed by transformational leadership style, and passive–avoidance was the least common. Emotional intelligence, the professional position and the perception of the organisational climate significantly increased the transformational leadership score. © 2020 FDI World Dental Federation

AB  - Although researchers predominately test for linear relationships between variables, at times there may be theoretical and even empirical reasons for expecting nonlinear functions. We examined if the relation between intelligence (IQ) and perceived leadership might be more accurately described by a curvilinear single-peaked function. Following Simonton's (1985) theory, we tested a specific model, indicating that the optimal IQ for perceived leadership will appear at about 1.2 standard deviations above the mean IQ of the group membership. The sample consisted of midlevel leaders from multinational private-sector companies. We used the leaders' scores on the Wonderlic Personnel Test (WPT)-a measure of IQ-to predict how they would be perceived on prototypically effective leadership (i.e., transformational and instrumental leadership). Accounting for the effects of leader personality, gender, age, as well as company, country, and time fixed effects, analyses indicated that perceptions of leadership followed a curvilinear inverted-U function of intelligence. The peak of this function was at an IQ score of about 120, which did not depart significantly from the value predicted by the theory. As the first direct empirical test of a precise curvilinear model of the intelligence-leadership relation, the results have important implications for future research on how leaders are perceived in the workplace. © 2017 American Psychological Association.

AB  - In a competitive and evolving working scenario, the leadership is called to respond to the challenges related to the management of internal and external transformative processes of the organization. In order to validate the Italian version of the Global Transformational (GTL) and Empowering Leadership Behavior (ELB) scales and to test their reliability, a study involved a sample of 852 workers, mainly women (N = 553, 64.9%), with an average age of 41.1 years (SD = 10.17). The factorial structure of the Italian version of the GTL and ELB was examined through a confirmation factorial analysis (CFA) with Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). The results are satisfactory for both tools in terms of factorial structure, validity, and reliability; the scores of the two scales are also positively correlated with innovative behavior, satisfaction, and organizational trust. © 2024 Societa Editrice Il Mulino.

AB  - Background: A patient safety culture needs to be developed for quality and safe care in health care institutions. Executive nurses having transformational leadership behavior have an important effect on establishing a patient safety culture in hospitals. Objectives: The aim of this study is to reveal transformational leadership practices of unit charge nurses from their own perspective and the perspective of staff nurses they work with, to determine the patient safety culture perceptions of unit charge nurses and staff nurses, and to examine the relationship between transformational leadership practices and patient safety culture. Methods: This descriptive, relationship-seeking and cross-sectional study was conducted between March and June 2014 in four hospitals in Konya province. The sample of the study consisted of 70 unit charge nurses and 357 staff nurses working with these unit charge nurses. Participation rate in the study is 84.5%. Data were collected by using the Demographic Data Form, Leadership Practices Inventory and Patient Safety Culture Hospital Questionnaire. Means, t test, percentages, standard deviation and Spearman's tests were used in the analysis of the data. Results: According to the evaluations of the unit charge nurses and staff nurses; it was found that the unit charge nurses' averages scores for prodding others into action, encouraging others and questioning the process sub-dimension and total leadership practice were significantly higher than those of the staff nurses. Patient Safety Culture perceptions of unit charge nurses are higher than service nurses. According to the findings obtained from the study, there is a positive relationship between nurses' transformational leadership practices and patient safety culture. Conclusion: In the study, it has been shown that there is a positive relationship between nurses' transformational leadership practices and patient safety culture. In order to create a positive patient safety culture in the units of charge nurses, it is necessary to develop the unit charge nurses' transformational leadership practices. © 2021, Dokuz Eylul University.

AB  - Despite the diversity in the healthcare setting, Indian nurses are underrepresented in leadership positions. Several hospital systems have formal leadership programs to train nurses to be effective leaders. However, few programs prepare minority nurses for leadership roles. This article discusses the development and implementation of a leadership program for Indian nurses by the National Association of Indian Nurses of America. The curriculum was based on the transformational leadership principles. The post-test analysis showed an improvement in the overall scores of the Leadership Practice Inventory. An increase in the representation of minority nurses in leadership positions can positively influence healthcare disparities. © 2019

AB  - Aim: This study aims to determine the level of individual innovativeness among nurses and examine the effects of professional and demographic factors and transformational leadership on individual innovativeness. Method: The research was conducted as a cross-sectional study involving 315 nurses. Data were collected using the Individual Innovativeness Scale, Global Transformational Leadership Scale, and information form on socio-demographic and professional characteristics of nurses. Analyses included t-tests, One-way ANOVA, correlation, and regression. Results: The mean individual innovativeness score was 59.41 (SD=9.41), indicating a moderate level. Classification of innovativeness levels showed that 2.9% were "innovators," 13.7% were "early adopters," 42.5% were "late majority," and 34% were "laggards." A positive and moderate relationship was found between individual innovativeness and transformational leadership (r=0.66; p<0.05). Professional and demographic variables explained 47% of the total variance in individual innovativeness (R²=0.47; p<0.01), increasing to 62% when transformational leadership was included (R²=0.62; ΔR²=0.15; p<0.01). Age, years of experience, and education were significant predictors of individual innovativeness (p<0.01). Conclusion: The findings reveal a need to improve nurses’ innovativeness and highlight the critical role of transformational leadership in fostering innovative behavior. Promoting transformational leadership skills and implementing innovative professional development programs are recommended in healthcare settings. © 2025 The Authors.

AB  - The Indonesian education system is confronted with low-quality teaching, which has manifested low Teacher Competency Test (UKG) scores and incompetency among teachers. In Banjarmasin City, the UKG score in 2016 was 62.73%, while, on average, the Teacher Performance Assessment (PKG) score was 49.148, which is 25.852 lower than the required minimum of 75.0. Existing literature has established the core role of school leadership in improving the quality of education offered in public institutions. The aim of the present investigation was to explore the synergistic impacts of principal's leadership approaches and teacher motivation on performance among high school teachers from three schools in Banjarmasin City, Indonesia. A qualitative research framework was adopted, which entailed the utilization of purposive sampling technique, semi-structured interviews, and thematic analysis to collect and analyze data. The findings suggest that in the selected institutions, principals have a direct influence on teacher motivation through the provision of supportive governance. In addition, school leadership indirectly shapes teacher performance through lobbying for equitable pay for their subordinates and ensuring access to teaching resources, which in turn influence teacher motivation levels. The findings through quantitative technique indicate a significant and positive influence of transformational leadership on teacher performance. © Primrose Hall Publishing Group.

AB  - Managerial coaching is currently seen as an effective leadership practice facilitating learning process of the employees for performing better and being more effective in organizations. This article builds on recent research on the importance of the managerial coaching by empirically investigating the effects of a cognitive-behavioral coaching programme over mid-level managers. Due to the similarities between managerial coaching behaviors and transformational leadership behaviors, we have adopted the transformational leadership model as theoretical framework for evaluating management behaviors. The study used a pre-posttest approach to test the effects of the coaching program especially designed for 23 mid-level managers having as responsibility the supervision of production teams in a multinational organization. The major aims of the program consisted of: developing managerial coaching skills, assertive communication skills, motivation of subordinates. Overall, the analysis of results elicited an increase of scores in the leadership behavior dimensions measured by multifactor leadership questionnaire that are part of the managerial coaching skills. Besides, the effectiveness perceived as an indicator of performance was significantly higher upon completion of the coaching program. Findings suggest that coaching, as a professional development method, has great potential to contribute to the managerial behaviors that facilitate development at subordinate level, as they are captured by some transformational and transactional scales. Such knowledge can be informative for practitioners as well in developing effective managers and leaders and understanding and managing employee attitudes and behaviors in organizations. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.
