AB  - Principal leadership behaviors affect the improvement of school outcomes significantly, not only by providing psychological and professional support for teachers but also by facilitating a positive learning environment at school. This has cultivated both policy and research interest in understanding how principals' leadership behaviors can leverage student outcomes both directly and indirectly through teachers. In this quest, three leadership models have become prominent due to their close relation to classroom instruction and learning: instructional, transformational, and distributed leadership. The current study aims to reveal the relationships between these leadership behaviors of principals and student outcomes as well as assess the mediating effect of teacher self-efficacy on this relationship. Utilizing meta-analytic structural equation modelling (MASEM) methodology, the study analyzes data from prior studies to offer a more comprehensive and holistic analysis of the complex relationships between the variables. The analysis of data from 90 studies showed that all three leadership behaviors affected student outcomes both directly and indirectly through teacher self-efficacy. They also had a moderate direct influence on teacher self-efficacy, while teacher self-efficacy had a moderate effect on student outcomes. These results reiterate the significance of principals' leadership for learning to facilitate student outcomes and suggest that the integrated practice of leadership in accordance with contextual requirements could leverage the effectiveness and improvement of schools. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The relevance of school principals’ leadership behaviour in promoting school effectiveness and improvement is less discussed and known in emerging countries, explicitly in Sub-Saharan countries. Moreover, there is a significant inconclusive body of literature on the most dominant leadership model (instructional (IL) and transformational (TL) in determining the coherence of school improvement and student academic achievement. Hence, the current study extended the knowledge by examining the impact of IL and TL on implementing the School Improvement Programme (SIP) in the Ethiopian context designed to foster students’ academic performance. This study randomly sampled and surveyed 2880 public secondary school teachers and 70 principals. The study’s findings suggested that school principals’ personal information, gender, academic qualification, and leadership experience determine their leadership style, the coherence of SIP, and school performance. Unlike previous evidence, this study’s findings shed light on the principals’ IL and TL practice, which significantly impacted students’ academic achievement through the mediating role of coherent SIP. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Background/purpose: This study aims to investigate the influence of leadership (principal and teacher leadership) and school climate on student achievement as well as the moderating effect of some variables in this relationship. Materials/methods: With this purpose, a meta-analysis of data gathered from a total of 90 empirical studies including 83,337 participants was performed. The random effects model was utilized to measure the overall effect sizes. Results: The results showed that leadership and school climate had a moderate effect on academic achievement. In the USA context, organizational climate, principal leadership, and teacher leadership affected student achievement respectively. However, in the Turkish context, teacher leadership had a greater influence on student achievement the school climate, and principal leadership. The analysis also revealed that the influence of leadership on student achievement was attained through transformational, supportive, distributed, and instructional leadership practices respectively. Among the moderators tested, only the education level was determined to moderate the effect of school climate on student achievement. It was also concluded that an open organizational climate in primary schools had a greater effect on academic achievement. Conclusion: The current study evidenced that leadership and school climate are significant variables in improving student achievement. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to delve into the characteristics, professional competencies, leadership attitudes, and behaviors of successful school principals (SSPs) in socioeconomically disadvantaged schools. Utilizing a systematic grounded theory method (SGTM), we conducted research in the provinces of Amasya, Çorum, Samsun, and Tokat in Türkiye. Purposeful and theoretical sampling methods were employed to recruit successful school principals, deputy principals, teachers, students, and parents from secondary schools affiliated with the Ministry of National Education (MoNE). The data draws on unstructured individual and focus group interviews, as well as documents and observations. All the data obtained were inductively analyzed through open, axis, and selective coding stages. Based on the codes, sub-categories, categories, themes, and dimensions from the analyses, we designed the Contextual Successful School Principalship Model (CSSPM), which falls into four dimensions as follows: individual, managerial, organizational, and instructional. SSPs in this study mostly tend to display paternalistic leadership attitudes and behaviors in terms of dedication and self-sacrifice, serving, intrinsic motivation, and influencing stakeholders. They exhibit almost all the attitudes and behaviors of servant leadership, act according to some national and moral values, and experience national attitudes such as patriotism and nationalism intensely. By giving importance to the academic socialization of students' mothers, successful school principals exhibit transformational and instructional leadership behaviors. They act strategically to directly involve mothers in enhancing student achievement, demonstrating their commitment to fostering an inclusive and supportive educational environment. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Learning occurs at all levels in school and leadership for learning is an integral part of the school and that for learning to happen, there must be trust, autonomy and high level of teacher professionalism with a strong professional learning community. This chapter synthesizes information from various studies of principal instructional leadership since its inception in the 1980s, its subjection to the various changes that happen in schools during the accountability era and school-based management period, as well as the rising and waning of various theories, to show how it is influenced leading to its evolution into 'leadership for learning' which is also known as 'leading learning'. The original model of instructional leadership is initially described and how the subsequent transformational leadership, distributed leadership, and teacher leadership are incorporated into the original instructional leadership theory to produce an integrated leadership for learning were also elaborated. This chapter re-visits the belief and importance placed on school leadership in addition to its crucial role in students' academic achievement and school improvement. Based on reviews of earlier leadership theories, more insights into leadership across different contexts and professional activities can illustrate some of the benefits of such an approach. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - This research scrutinized the scientometric objectivity of school leadership research in Asia. Publication records between 2018 and 2022 were extracted from Scopus and the Web of Science, after which the bibliographic data set was administered using ScientoPy and VOSviewer. A total of 958 publications were issued over the last five years, with 2020 having the highest number of published articles. The International Journal of Innovation, Creativity and Change was the most productive source (26 papers), Hallinger was the most published author, and “Examining school leadership effects on student achievement: the role of contextual challenges and constraints” had the most significant impact with 33 citations. The top 10 keywords were “leadership,” “higher education,” “transformational leadership,” “principal,” “education,” “school principals,” “school leadership,” “instructional leadership,” “educational leadership,” and “organizational commitment.” With 240 publications, Indonesia was Asia’s leading contributor in this research domain. The results indicated that school leadership research is important. It is recommended that future researchers extend this research to other regions, such as Africa, North America, South America, Antarctica, Europe, and Australia, to gain a fuller picture of school leadership studies across the world. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - It is clear from the literature that there is no consensus on the most effective type of leadership behavior which promotes one of the main objectives of education, namely student achievement. This current study was initiated due to the prevalence of low student achievement as well as the observed controversies regarding effective types of leadership behaviors in secondary schools in the Gedeo Zone of Ethiopia. The aim of the study was to examine the effect of secondary school principals’ leadership behaviors on student outcomes in the zone and consequently to identify effective types of leadership constructs that could enhance learners’ success. An explanatory sequential mixed-design approach was used with a sample of six schools which were chosen by using a maximum variation strategy. Out of these six sampled schools, eighteen (18) participants, comprising of six (6) principals, four (4) district supervisors, two (2) zone education experts and six (6) PTSA chairmen were chosen for the qualitative phase. These participants were selected purposively as they have a better understanding, by virtue of their position regarding the effect of principals’ leadership behavior on student achievement. A close-ended questionnaire was used to collect quantitative data, while interviews and document analysis were used as research instruments in the qualitative phase. The findings of this study indicate that effective practicing of a combination of instructional and transformational leadership behaviors, in integrative ways, enhances student outcomes. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The quality of school leaders and teachers is critical to both school development and student achievement. Thus, quality school leaders are needed for teachers to perform their assigned roles and tasks in line with the school goals. This paper examined the effect of transformational leadership behaviours of school principals on teacher agency. The study adopted a correlational research method and was conducted with 349 teachers working in primary, middle, and secondary schools of 15 cities located in eastern, central, and western Anatolia regions. Based on the variables observed in the school, path analysis was applied to analyse the relationships between implicit variables. A direct relationship was found between the transformational leadership practice of school principals and teachers’ behaviours. In addition, transformational leadership practices of school principals had a direct as well as a moderate effect on teacher agency; teacher self-efficacy led to an indirect increase on this effect. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - This article explored the different clusters of leadership styles and the relationship between principal leadership style and student academic achievement in domains of mathematics, reading, science, and collaborative problem-solving in Germany and China. We used PISA 2015 data covering 6,504 students and 256 school principals from German schools and 9,841 students and 268 school leaders from Chinese schools. Results identified three leadership styles in Germany, namely, transformational (23.4%), instructional (41.3%), and integrated (35.3%) leadership, and two leadership styles in China, namely, transformational (38.6%) and instructional (61.4%) principals. Principals with instructional and integrated leadership had higher student achievements in Germany, whereas only principals with transformational leadership had slightly higher student achievements in China. Moreover, three leadership styles in Germany and two in China showed their relationships with each domain of student achievement. In conclusion, principals in Germany and China had different priorities in leading schools. The differences that principal leadership made on student achievements highlighted the differences in principals’ situational context and leading characteristics between Germany and China. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Aim: While integrated leadership has received significant scholarly attention in the past decade, most existing research in this vein has focused on its impact on student achievement and often dismissed how it might be related to instructional practices, which are at the center of many school reforms. In this research, we examined the relationship between integrated leadership and teacher professional learning and teacher practices in Turkey, where educational policy makers have recently introduced several school reform initiatives. More specifically, we aimed to examine the moderating function of transformational leadership in the relationship between instructional leadership and teacher practices, with an emphasis on the mediating role of teacher professional learning. Research Design: We conducted this study with a cross-sectional design and moderated mediation model. Data collected from 616 teachers working in a mix of primary and secondary schools in Turkey were analyzed using structural equation modeling and bootstrapping tests. Findings: We found evidence that transformational leadership acted as a moderator of the indirect effect of principal instructional leadership on teachers' instructional practices through teacher professional learning. Implications: This study adds to the accumulated body of knowledge on the effects of school leadership by concluding that the effect of instructional leadership on teacher learning and practice is contingent upon the extent to which principals enact transformational leadership. School principals who adopt a more comprehensive leadership approach that combines instructional leadership and transformational leadership practices can maximize their effects on student achievement through teacher learning, and better address the ever-growing demands of educational reforms. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - School leadership has been identified as a key function in assuring quality in education. The instructional leadership model refers to the role and the functions of school leadership to employ different management tasks with regards to teaching and learning. Instructional leadership role includes (a) developing mission and goals, (b) managing the educational production function, (c) promoting an academic learning climate, and (d) developing a supportive work environment. Instructional leaders were described as leading from a combination of both expertise and charisma focused primarily on the improvement of student learning outcomes. The monograph, entitled Instructional Leadership and Effective Teaching and Learning and written by Nazmi Xhomara, is dedicated to school instructional leadership as an important factor that influences teaching and learning at school. In the first chapter, the author presents and analyzes educational leadership vs educational management, as well as models of educational leadership and management. The author argues on the importance of different leadership models, such as managerial leadership, transformational leadership, participative leadership, interpersonal leadership, transactional leadership, postmodern leadership, moral leadership, and contingent leadership. Chapters Two, Three, and Four shed light on instructional leadership and teaching and learning, understanding of instructional leadership, the concept and practice of instructional leadership, instructional school leadership and learning environment, attributes of instructional leaders, instructional excellence, instructional leadership time management, effective teaching and teachers, as well as teaching challenges and learning environment. Meanwhile, the author has analyzed constructivism, student intelligence, understanding of supervision, instructional collegial supervision, supervision approaches, understanding of evaluation of teaching and learning, teacher evaluation, and instructional observing instruments in chapters Five, Six, and Seven. Chapters Eight and Nine are focused especially on the research work of the relationships between instructional leadership and teaching, learning, and students' achievements, as well as on an empirical study designed and conducted in Albania as a case. Chapters Ten and Eleven are dedicated to instructional leadership preparation and the future of instructional leadership. As a conclusion, Xhomara indicates that principals are responsible for developing school climates and cultures that support the very best instructional practices. The new era of instructional leadership has predictably placed significant demands for accountability for student success and equity on the principal as well as for the university programs that prepare them. Working in twenty-first-century schools, the instructional leader is held more accountable than ever for student success. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - 1. Background Systematic reviews may inform public policies and contribute to the building of a knowledge base. However, reviews of school leadership research are relatively rare in Taiwan. This study conducted a bibliometric review to analyze journal papers by Taiwanese scholars in the Scopus database published in the previous 20 years. The focus was to examine the connection between Taiwanese and global research on school leadership. 2. Research questions On the basis of the research background, four research questions were proposed: (1) What is the volume and growth trajectory of Taiwanese school leadership research?(2) What is the international visibility of Taiwanese school leadership research as revealed through citation analysis? (3) What are the main topics covered by Taiwanese school leadership research and how do they correspond to the global trend? (4) What is the intellectual structure of Taiwanese school leadership research and how do it connect with the global literature? 3. Theoretical framework (1) Intellectual development of school leadership research The theory movement in the 1950s and 1960s highlighted the development of educational administration research. Griffiths (1959) categorized these theories into four groups: social system and role theory, leadership theory, decision theory, and organizational theory. In the 1970s,contingency theory, which emphasizes the influence of context on leadership, was proposed. With the growing interest in school effectiveness and school reform, the organizational perspective was applied to investigate school leadership. Instructional leadership was also emphasized from then on. In the 1990s, other leadership approaches such as transformational leadership, moral leadership, and distributed leadership became popular in school leadership research. With the power paradigm shifting from a heroic view of leaders to a more dispersed view of power, distributed leadership and teacher leadership were also highly recognized. In response to the international context, leadership for learning, which includes elements of instructional leadership, transformational leadership, and shared leadership, has gained global attention in the new millennium. (2) Retrospective view of school leadership research Systematic reviews did not appear in the field of educational administration until the 1980s. EPPI-Centre (2012) indicated the four key features of systematic reviews. First, a high quality systematic review is explicit and is conducted using transparent methods. Second, it follows a standard set of stages. Third, the review is accountable, replicable, and updateable. Fourth, users should be involved to ensure reports are relevant and useful. The elements of reviews include the central topics of interest, guiding questions, and goals; a conceptual perspective for guiding there view’s selection, evaluation, and interpretation of the studies; sources and types of data; data evaluation and analysis; and the major results of the review (Hallinger, 2014). However, according to Hallinger’s study in 2014, only eight reviews met these criteria. Of the eight studies, some used critical synthesis, some adopted meta-analysis, and some employed both. In recent years, network analysis, data mining, and bibliometric analysis are increasingly being applied in systematic reviews. In addition to a greater diversity in methods, the regions under review have expanded from the United States and United Kingdom to many other regions. This development can be attributed to Hallinger’s effort to initiate international collaboration to build the knowledge base of educational leadership in Asia. Because of the growing interest in the academic development in non-Western countries, he promoted the use of systematic reviews to examine studies in Asia, Africa, Saudi Arabia, and Central and South America, which resulted in more than 30 systematic reviews on educational leadership and management. A wide range of research topics is a prominent feature of educational leadership and management research. Five topics that have gained frequent attention are social justice, female leadership, school leadership preparation and development, trust, and instruction and instructional leadership. The following are the topics of frontier research in this field: principal, school leadership, and student achievement; distributed leadership, instructional leadership, teacher learning, accountability, school improvement, school reform, and leadership development; and race, justice, and urban education. In Taiwan, research reviews on educational leadership are scant. According to Lin’s (2000) review, only a few studies have focused on the impact of principals on students. Pan’s (2010) review indicated that of all the educational leadership studies in government-funded projects and journals,70% of the topics were related to principals’ leadership styles and behaviors. The distribution of the research topics was not sufficiently diversified to reflect global academic development. 4. Research method This study used bibliometric analysis on the Scopus database to analyze Taiwanese school leadership research. The review process was based on the steps of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) developed by Moher et al. (2009). After the process of screening, identification, eligibility determination, and inclusion, 95 papers were included for analysis. Descriptive analysis, citation analysis, co-occurrence analysis of keywords, and co-citation analysis were conducted to address the research questions. 5. Research findings The study had the following three key findings: (1) Concerning the volume of publication in journals, the first English paper on Taiwanese school leadership research did not appear until 2001.Although the promotion of the world university rankings and the launch of the Top University Project have changed the trend of solely using Chinese for academic writing, the number of English studies on school leadership remains limited. Moreover, only 14.7% of papers are published in the core journals of education leadership and management. (2) A citation analysis revealed that the international visibility of Taiwanese school leadership research is low. The average number of papers of the 10 most cited Taiwanese scholars is 3.5, and they have been cited an average of 45.2times. The number of citations of Taiwanese scholars is 3.33 times less than that of African educational leadership research and 11.78 times less than that of research on three emerging regions. (3) The research topics selected by Taiwanese scholars may highlight international academic development; however, some underdeveloped topics remain such as social justice leadership, organizational theory, institutional theory, and social capital. The current co-citation analysis revealed the four schools of thought of Taiwanese school leadership, namely leadership for learning, distributed forms of leadership, leadership behavior and its impact, and social network. 6. Contributions Systematic reviews on school leadership are scarce in Taiwan. The present study conducted a 206 bibliometric analysis to examine the development and features of Taiwanese school leadership literature which is innovative in the research method. The connection between Taiwanese studies on school leadership research and global scholarship has seldom been addressed in relevant research. The current analysis presents the development of Taiwanese school leadership and its connection with global trends, providing critical insights and directions for future research on school leadership in Taiwan. 7. Implications The present findings indicate the future direction of Taiwanese academic development in the field of educational administration. First, publishing more research in English can help increase the international impact of Taiwanese scholars. Greater exposure in English publications can highlight the fruitful outcome of Taiwanese school leadership research internationally. Building the academic connections between Taiwan and other countries will also be beneficial. Second, the current study identified a gap between Taiwanese school leadership research and the global trend. Including more diversified topics may help broaden the scope of research. Some topics recommended for future study include social justice leadership, organizational theory, institutional theory, social capital theory, social justice theory, and critical racialism. Third, conducting periodic replication studies using bibliometric analysis may help track the development of Taiwanese school leadership research. In particular, this method allows for a comparison of the distinguishing features of research among different periods. Fourth, a bibliometric analysis on Taiwanese school leadership research published in Chinese would be of considerable value. Taiwan has several literature databases that collect domestic research. However, the data structure provides insufficient information for an effective bibliometric analysis. To maximize the usefulness of these databases, their data structure design merits special consideration. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Persistence for achievement reflected from the willingness and determination of principal to implement quality leadership will facilitate the improvement of teachers’ performance, and the two will be the determinant factors for the students’ ultimate achievement. This study aims at analyzing empirical data on the effect of instructional, transformational and spiritual leadership as independent variables, with school quality as the dependent variable. In addition, the intervening variable is teachers’ performance. This study employed the quantitative approach in which samples of 181 teachers were re taken using the proportional random sampling technique. All data were then analysed using the SEM technique with the AMOS 24 application. The findings show that: (1) there is a direct effect of instructional leadership on teachers’ performance, transformational leadership on teachers’ performance, spiritual leadership on teachers’ performance, instructional leadership on students’ achievement, transformational leadership on students’ achievement, spiritual leadership on students’ achievement, and teachers’ performance on students’ achievement. In addition, (2) there is an indirect effect of instructional leadership on students’ achievement through teachers’ performance, transformational leadership on students’ achievement through teachers’ performance and spiritual leadership on students’ achievement through teachers’ performance. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - With the nation’s public schools serving a more diverse student population than ever before, the role of the school leader is becoming increasingly complex. Research indicates principal preparation programs are inadequately preparing leaders to address the systemic inequities hindering non-White students’ achievement. Administrators in urban public schools face particularly well-documented equity challenges. Providing urban school leaders with the tools to navigate the pressures of their jobs while driving equitable student outcomes is a relevant policy consideration. This chapter presents emotional intelligence (EI) as an agent of transformational leadership and positions emotionally intelligent leadership as a meaningful urban education reform. In rooting our analysis in organizational and ecological systems theories, we aim to (1) nest EI literature within extant research addressing challenges uniquely affecting urban schooling contexts, (2) explore how EI can support urban leaders in addressing and mitigating school-based inequities, and (3) examine benefits of building school leaders’ EI capacity in relation to the most current federal education policies and urban demographic data. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Transformational leadership is one of the models for the initial change that can encourage Madrasah Aliyah to excel, both at the national and international levels. This study is a qualitative study with an interactive analysis model on transformational leadership strategies at the international Madrasah Aliyah Amanatul Ummah Mojokerto and the Serpong Insan Cendekia State Madrasah Aliyah. This study concluded that the first strategy to increase the influence of the idealism of the madrasah principal towards an international pesantren-based Madrasah Aliyah is the strong commitment between the principal and teachers, employees, students, as well as parents, beginning with planning (RKM) using school review, quality assurance, benchmarking, and quality control accompanied by exemplary values, an effort to maintain mutual trust as well as the sincerity of all stakeholders. Then, the second strategy is to foster inspirational motivation for the principals of international pesantren-based Madrasah Aliyah which is reflected in the ability of madrasah principals who can motivate and inspire their subordinates to improve the quality of education together. For example, the achievement of madrasah principals, teachers and students winning the international olympiad between 2010-2020 is supported by the principle of Islamic boarding school that is ‘The Islamic Role Model is The First Key to Build Great Leaders’. Furthermore, The third strategy is to strengthen the intellectual stimulus of Madrasah Aliyah’s principal with superior international standards based on Islamic boarding school values, which is reflected in several positive changes made and achieved by the madrasah’s principal, both the quality of the input, process, and output, such as student achievements in national and international levels such as scholarships to the Middle East, Europe, Japan, and Australia. Finally, the last strategy is to transform the madrasah principal’s individualized considereation towards superior international pesantren-based Madrasah Aliyah which is reflected in the ability of madrasah principals in managing human resources appropriately, including managing the right competencies for human resources through the competency development programs for teachers and employees continuously; and improving abilities through training supported by the principles of responsibility and exemplary, which are the characteristics of pesantren. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - As studies capable of establishing a mediating role of transformational classroom leadership between transformational school leadership and students' learning achievement are short in supply in the Thai high school context, this quantitative study aimed to investigate this role and compared the students' learning achievement among different school sizes. A total of 199 teachers, who taught O-NET and PISA key subjects-45 teachers in English, 77 teachers in science, 77 teachers in math-from the five regions of Thailand representing small, medium, and large school size were recruited through a stratified sampling technique and were asked to rate their principal's transformational school leadership and own transformational classroom leadership. A Thai version of the transformational leadership questionnaire was developed, which consisted of a self-rating and a rater form. Partial Least Square Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) was employed to find the causal relationship, and ANOVA version SPSS 21 was used to compare the SLA among three different school sizes. The study found that transformational school leadership had direct effects on transformational classroom leadership, but transformational classroom leadership did not have a direct effect on English, science, and math teaching. The study also found that large schools had better students' learning achievement compared to small and medium-sized schools, and small-sized schools had the lowest average score in English, science, and math. Based on these new findings, the study made guidelines for the Thai Ministry of Education, Thai school principals, and Thai teachers. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Purpose: Systems educational reform in developing countries through effective principal capacity- building programs is essential for improving student learning, with the purpose of this paper being to use case studies to identify key success factors in the implementation of an instructional leadership program in the developing country of Kiribati. Design/methodology/approach: A case study approach involving mixed methods including semi-structured interviews and document analysis was used within three purposively sampled schools to examine implementation success factors relevant to instructional leadership literature Findings: The case studies reveal the overall value of the Kiribati instructional leadership program involving school leader workshops and ongoing coaching support, with instructional leadership reflecting directive and collaborative, as well as transformative theoretical aspects. Key implementation success factors within researched schools were leaders undertaking regular observations in classrooms, systematic tracking of student achievement and nurturing a positive culture for learning, as well as establishment of various collaborative processes involving community and teacher peer learning groups. Research limitations/implications: The study provides in-depth information through teacher and school leader interviews and examining relevant school documentation artefacts. A limitation is that the study involved only three schools and was undertaken less than a year into program implementation. Future research involving more schools and several years after implementation would be beneficial to investigate sustainability across the school system and longer-term program impacts. Practical implications: The data provides practical tips for school leaders regarding effective teacher capacity-building approaches, as well as providing information for policy makers, especially in developing countries, about effective professional development programs for school leaders and teachers. 10; 10; Originality/value: The study examines a system-wide workshop series and coaching approach to school leader and teacher capacity-building in a developing country from a theoretical and practical perspective relevant to instructional leadership and also transformational leadership, which is an under-researched area. 10; 10; 10; © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The study investigated how principals and assistant principals perceived their school discipline policies and their impact on student achievement. The investigator conducted a mixed method study using a survey questionnaire (to include research developed questions and questions from the Belief on Discipline Survey) and an open-ended question. The study examined principals and assistant principals who lead in secondary schools in northern Florida and assessed differences in the implementation of discipline policies between high poverty low-achieving (HPLA) and high poverty high-achieving (HPHA) schools and the impact on student achievement. The study also examined the factors these principals and assistant principals perceived as facilitating and hindering discipline policy. Descriptive statistics were used to examine demographic data. The study used a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) to assess differences in the perceived impact of school discipline policies on student achievement between principals and assistant principals (APs) at HPHA schools and HPLA schools. Qualitative data were analyzed using the constant comparative method. The results of this study suggest there were significant differences in the characteristics of principals and APs serving high poverty (HP) schools, differences in how principals and APs in HP schools perceive their discipline practices in relationship to student success. Also, the findings suggest there are some differences in the qualities of transformational leadership (TL) between principals and APs HPHA and HPLA schools. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Leadership style is an important aspect in students’ academic performance in schools. Transformational leadership style is associated with the students’ academic achievement in KCSE. The study sought to establish the relationship between idealized influence of principals’ transformational leadership style and students’ academic performance in KCSE in Bomet County in Kenya. The descriptive survey design was used for this study whose target population comprised of 130 secondary schools and five Quality Assurance and Standards Officers in Bomet County. Stratified random sampling procedure was adopted to sample out schools as boys’, girls’ and mixed schools; then Slovin’s formula was used to obtain a total of 108 schools. While purposive sampling procedure was applied to choose one Director of Studies from each 108 schools selected and five Quality Assurance and Standards Officers from the five sub-counties in Bomet County. A total sample of 118 respondents from 108 secondary schools and the five sub-counties participated in the study. When collecting the data, instruments used were Director of Studies’ questionnaires, Quality Assurance and Standards Officers’ interview guides, school and Bomet County Director of Education KCSE records. Chi-square test was adopted to establish the relationship between principals’ idealized influence and academic performance and the results showed that principals’ idealized influence had a strong significant relationship with students’ academic performance in KCSE. Thus, idealized influence characteristics are most effective in promoting students’ academic achievement. The study recommends that the idealized influence should be adopted and displayed by principals in order to improve academic performance in KCSE examinations. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - This article presents a study on the extent to which the leadership of Brazilian school principals has helped improve students’ achievements as reflected by the results of external evaluations of schools. The study sought to measure leadership dimensions based on microdata from contextual questionnaires answered by principals and teachers; propose a model that relates leadership dimensions to student achievement as reflected by schools’ IDEB results; and verify the relationships between leadership dimensions and student achievement. To that end, we performed multivariate analyzes, specifically structural equations modeling, on a database containing microdata from Prova Brasil and IDEB values. Results show that it is possible to measure leadership dimensions using these microdata. Based on the conceptual model developed, there is evidence that the relationships developed by the principal within the school have a greater effect on teachers’ commitment to improve teaching and learning, thus indirectly affecting school performance. In addition, school principals have sought to exercise transformational leadership combined with pedagogical leadership, which represents a challenge for them, since it covers many knowledge areas. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The principal's leadership style is one of the most common ways of conceptualizing school leadership behaviours. We lack understanding, however, of how the effectiveness of school leadership styles varies across degrees of challenging circumstances. Data obtained from a quantitative survey of primary school teachers in Israel (N = 570) and from the Ministry of Education database were used to account for principals' leadership styles and their effectiveness in schools facing more challenging circumstances (N = 15) and in those facing less challenging circumstances (N = 46). Differences were found in the relations between principals' transactional behaviours on one hand and the teaching dimension of school culture and principals' perceived effectiveness on the other, as a function of challenging school circumstances. The study also found a difference in the relations of principals' transformational behaviours and the safety dimension of school culture, by level of challenging school circumstances. The data also revealed that in schools facing less challenging circumstances, principals' passive behaviours were related to students' achievements and principals' perceived effectiveness, but not in schools facing more challenging circumstances. The findings and their implications are discussed. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - This study aims to explore whether there is a relationship between the leadership style of school principals and the performance of their students. For this purpose, a multiple case study was developed in three private subsidized schools in a city on Northern Chile. The multiple case study included the application of a questionnaire, semi-structured interviews to members of the principal's work team who participated in the study in the three schools, and the consideration of the score obtained by the establishment in a test used for measuring learning outcomes (SIMCE test). Results suggest that in the case of the three schools, transformational leadership has a positive impact on student outcomes. Additionally, unlike what is stated in other studies, transactional leadership is also a key determinant for the achievement obtained by students. Thus, this exploratory research validates the dimensions of the styles of transformational and transactional leadership, contributing to new findings that allow continuing with quantitative larger studies. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to examine the role of teacher job satisfaction and school climate in mediating the relative effects of principals’ instructional and transformational leadership practices on student outcomes. Design/methodology/approach – Guided by strong evidence from theories on school leadership and work psychology, the authors hypothesized relations among dimensions of principals’ instructional and transformational leadership behaviors, teachers’ perception of the school climate (social and affective, and physical environment), their job satisfaction and student achievement. The benefits of the principal’s leadership behaviors for student achievement are primarily hypothesized as indirect, with either a weak or statistically non-significant direct positive effect on student outcomes. Path modeling was applied to validate a mediated-effects model using cross-sectional survey data (306 principals, 1,539 teachers) obtained from 306 secondary schools in the two Indian metropolitan cities of New Delhi and Kolkata. Findings – Principal leadership behaviors were not associated directly with either teacher job satisfaction or school-aggregated student achievement. Rather, the transformational leader behavior showed an indirect effect, through the social and affective component of the school climate, on teacher job satisfaction. The physical climate, however, appeared to play a dominating role in mediating the instructional leadership effects on teacher job satisfaction. Comparing the relative indirect effect sizes of the instructional and transformational leadership behaviors on student achievement, principals appear to favor the former approach. Originality/value – This study provides further empirical evidence that instructional leadership better captures the impact of school leadership on student outcomes, when compared to its transformational counterpart. By identifying the relative effects of different leadership practices, school leaders and educational practitioners can focus more on altering the distribution and frequency of those practices that work best for ameliorating student achievement levels. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Purpose – Greater understanding about how variables mediate the relationship between leadership and achievement is essential to the success of reform efforts that hold leaders accountable for student learning. The purpose of this paper is to test a model of integrated transformational leadership including three important school mediators. Design/methodology/approach – In total, 5,392 students provided data on student engagement, and 569 teachers provided survey data on principal leadership and the collective teacher efficacy (CTE) and extra effort of their colleagues. Data were analyzed at the school level (n=51) using mediation analysis with the PROCESS macro to calculate the direct and indirect effects of all of the variables in the serial multiple mediator model. Findings – The model explained a significant amount of variance in both reading (38 percent) and mathematics (35 percent). CTE and student engagement mediated all of the leadership effects, demonstrating the importance of teacher and student relations in school improvement. The combined effect sizes are significantly greater than the effects of earlier TL models. Originality/value – This study contributes to “leadership for learning” research by demonstrating that refining transformational leadership behaviors to include instructional management can enhance a leader’s impact on achievement. As one of the few studies to examine student engagement as a mediator along with teacher mediators, the current study highlights the importance of teacher-student relations in school improvement. While collective efficacy mediated all of the effects of leadership on achievement, student emotional engagement also contributed to mathematics achievement. The study’s findings advance research into mutual influence processes, indicating that reciprocity may extend throughout the leader-teacher-student loop. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Purpose: This article illustrates how successful leaders combine the too often dichotomized practices of transformational and instructional leadership in different ways across different phases of their schools’ development in order to progressively shape and “layer” the improvement culture in improving students’ outcomes. Research Methods: Empirical data were drawn from a 3-year mixed-methods national study (“Impact Study”) that investigated associations between the work of principals in effective and improving primary and secondary schools in England and student outcomes as defined (but not confined) by their national examination and assessment results over 3 years. The research began with a critical survey of the extant literature, followed by a national survey that explored principals’ and key staff’s perceptions of school improvement strategies and actions that they believed had helped foster better student attainment. This was complemented by multiperspective in-depth case studies of a subsample of 20 schools. Findings: The research provides new empirical evidence of how successful principals directly and indirectly achieve and sustain improvement over time through combining both transformational and instructional leadership strategies. The findings show that schools’ abilities to improve and sustain effectiveness over the long term are not primarily the result of the principals’ leadership style but of their understanding and diagnosis of the school’s needs and their application of clearly articulated, organizationally shared educational values through multiple combinations and accumulations of time and context-sensitive strategies that are “layered” and progressively embedded in the school’s work, culture, and achievements. Implications: Mixed-methods research designs are likely to provide finer grained, more nuanced evidence-based understandings of the leadership roles and behaviors of principals who achieve and sustain educational outcomes in schools than single lens quantitative analyses, meta-analyses, or purely qualitative approaches. The findings themselves provide support for more differentiated, context sensitive training and development for aspiring and serving principals. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - This article focuses on challenges principals and lead teachers meet in diverse schools in Iceland. The study was conducted in nine schools at three school levels that have been successful in implementing social justice and in creating inclusive learning spaces. The framework of path-goal theory and transactional and transformational leadership guided the study. All the principals and lead teachers had a vision of pupil well-being and achievement. The findings show that all the principals and lead teachers were primarily participative in their leadership style. However, the leaders who were identified as being most proactive appeared to be more directive in style. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Educational institutions across the nation are being unsuccessful at meeting academic goals set by the states and preparing students to be college and career ready. Many schools around the globe are suffering from a shortage of experienced and competent school leaders that can bring about positive change and increase student achievement. Thus, the objective of this study was to determine the correlation between leadership practices, school culture, and student achievement in an effort to build the capacity of principal leaders. A correlational design was used to determine the relationship between principal leadership practices, culture, and achievement in elementary, middle, and high schools. A total of 216 teachers in 31 schools completed the Leadership Practices Inventory and School Culture Survey. A significant correlation was found between (a) leadership practices and school culture and (b) school culture and student achievement. No relationship was established between leadership practices and school culture. The results implied that school leaders who use transformational leadership practices indirectly impact student achievement through creating a positive school culture. It is recommended that principal preparation programs revamp leadership curriculum to develop leaders who can create positive school cultures and manage reform efforts. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Purpose: Effective styles of principal leadership can help address multiple issues in struggling schools, such as low student achievement and high rates of teacher attrition. Although the literature has nominated certain "idealized" leadership styles as being more or less effective, such as transformational, instructional, and shared instructional leadership, we have little evidence about how principals may or may not choose to practice these styles across U.S. schools. Research Design: Latent class analysis was used to identify different types of principals across the United States. We analyzed the 1999-2000 Schools and Staffing Survey as it presents a unique opportunity to study the different types of U.S. principals since it contains leadership measures not found in other national surveys. A final sample of 7,650 public schools and principals was included in the analysis. Findings: Instead of idealized leadership styles signifying variations in practice, the differences between types of principals were defined by the degree of principal and teacher leadership. Further, the school and principal context, such as school size, urbanicity, accountability performance, and principal background, predicted the three significantly different principal types: controlling, frequent principal leadership; balkanizing, high degree of leadership shared with teachers; or integrating, frequent principal leadership as well as a high degree of leadership shared with teachers. Conclusions: These types suggest that principals simultaneously practice leadership behaviors associated with multiple leadership styles in accordance with their background and school context. These findings provide support for the use of more complex models to assess school leader effectiveness. © The University Council for Educational Administration 2013. © 2014 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine the relative impact of different types of leadership on students’ academic and nonacademic outcomes. The methodology involved an analysis of findings from 27 published studies of the relationship between leadership and student outcomes. The first meta-analysis, including 22 of the 7 studies, involved a comparison of the effects of transformational and instructional leadership on student outcomes. The second meta-analysis involved a comparison of the effects of five inductively derived sets of leadership practices on student outcomes. Twelve of the studies contributed to this second analysis. The first meta-analysis indicated that the average effect of instructional leadership on student outcomes was three to four times that of transformational leadership. Inspection of the survey items used to measure school leadership revealed five sets of leadership practices or dimensions: establishing goals and expectations; resourcing strategically; planning, coordinating, and evaluating teaching and the curriculum; promoting and participating in teacher learning and development, and ensuring an orderly and supportive environment. The second meta-analysis revealed strong average effects for the leadership dimension involving promoting and participating in teacher learning and development and moderate effects for the dimensions concerned with goal setting and planning, coordinating, and evaluating teaching and the curriculum. The comparisons between transformational and instructional leadership and between the five leadership dimensions suggested that the more leaders focus their relationships, their work, and their learning on the core business of teaching and learning, the greater their influence on student outcomes. The article concludes with a discussion of the need for leadership research and practice to be more closely linked to the evidence on effective teaching and effective teacher learning. Such alignment could increase the impact of school leadership on student outcomes even further. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to compare transformational and instructional leadership theories, examine the unique impact that school leaders have on student achievement, and determine which specific leadership practices are associated with increased student achievement. The sample for this study consisted of 590 teachers in 37 elementary schools in the Intermountain West of the United States. Teachers rated their principals' leadership style according to the Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire (Transformational Leadership) and the Principal Instructional Management Rating Scale (Instructional leadership). Student achievement was measured by a criterion referenced test. Hypotheses were tested using regression analysis. Results indicated that instructional leadership explained more of the variance in student achievement than did transformational leadership. Principals' leadership style tended to have a meaningful impact on student achievement beyond the impact of school context and principal demographics. Specific leadership functions associated with student achievement were also identified and reported. Conclusion, implications and limitations are also discussed. © The Author(s) 2013. © 2014 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this study was to examine the ways principals in three high-needs middle schools enacted core leadership practices in concert with their immediate contexts to institutionalize comprehensive school reforms and support student learning. Research Methods: The schools were selected from a geographically stratified sample of public middle schools in a state in the southeastern United States. Multiple linear regression was used to identify schools performing better than expected considering their levels of poverty and other school-related factors. The final three schools, one from each geographic region, showed steady increases in academic achievement and school climate following the arrival of their principals. Data were primarily collected from interviews with principals, teaching and nonteaching staff, and parents using protocols adapted from the International Successful School Principalship Project. Findings: The findings explicate the large degree to which the leadership practices and beliefs that influenced student achievement in these schools were adapted to and commensurate with each school's immediate context. Furthermore, they illustrate how principals used these practices to institutionalize school-wide reform efforts as vehicles for leading change within their schools. Implications: The findings substantiate research on successful school leadership in high-needs middle schools. They also extend this research by examining the way core transformational and instructional leadership practices can be adapted to suit various school contexts and institutionalize school-wide reform efforts to enhance student learning. Further research is required to understand how principals decide to adapt their leadership practices, and how aspiring leaders can best learn to do so. © The University Council for Educational Administration 2013. © 2013 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Your start-up menu for super-charged culture change There's an invisible thread woven through your school that defines everything from dress codes to student success. It's your school culture, and reshaping it will yield highly visible improvements for teachers and students. Leslie Kaplan and William Owings guide you in improving leadership, teaching, learning, confidence, and trust throughout your school. Culture Re-Boot reframes school culture to include organizational learning, relational trust, accountability, program improvement, and teacher effectiveness while showing you how to: Be the transformational leader your school needs to reinvigorate your school culture; Establish a student-centered learning culture focused on student outcomes; Engage teachers in culture-focused leadership teams that support teacher and student learning; Get parents and community on-board to collaborate for student achievement; Connect professional development and school culture for maximum results Packed with hands-on culture re-boot activities to help school leaders and faculty revitalize their school's values and practices, this practical handbook for school improvement will energize your school's culture and build the capacity to help all students succeed. “Ever since Seymour Sarason wrote his seminal book on The Culture of Schools and the Problem of Change, we have known that ‘culture’ is at the heart of all organizational performance. But reformers keep forgetting this key fact. Kaplan and Owings’ book changes all that. Now in one place you can find everything you need to know to ‘re-boot’ you own school's culture.” —Michael Fullan, Author of Motion Leadership “As a principal focused on student achievement and school climate, I am excited to begin using these strategies and discussions to drive our conversations to a deeper and more meaningful level. The combination of school culture, professional learning community, and teacher/community leadership provides a compelling and unique exploration of real methods to sustain student achievement and school improvement.” —William Richard Hall, Jr., Principal R.

AB  - Purpose: Failure to identify any significant relationships between principal leadership and student achievement has proved concerns about the assumed value and legitimacy of principal leadership. The purpose of this paper is to contribute to the current literature by empirically testing the relationships between the principal leadership and the teacher self-efficacy, a construct which has a proven impact on student achievement. The role of collective efficacy on the relationship between transformational leadership of principals and self-efficacy of teachers was a special focus for the study. Design/methodology/approach: A causal comparative research design was employed to study the direct, indirect, and mediating relationships among principal leadership, teacher self-efficacy, and collective efficacy in schools. The participants included a cluster-random sample of 813 primary school teachers. Data gathering instruments composed of a combination of the Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire, the Collective Teacher Efficacy Scale and the Teacher's Sense of Efficacy Scale. A structural equation modelling with path analysis was employed to test the research models and hypotheses. Findings: Findings of the study demonstrated that collective efficacy and transformation leadership jointly shape teachers' self-efficacy. There was a significant relationship between principals' transformational leadership and teachers' self-efficacy beliefs. This relationship was mediated and magnified by collective efficacy in schools. Research limitations/implications: The study has the common limitations of the self-reported perceptions of participants. Originality/value: The study enlightened the little-known causal relationship mechanisms through which transformational leadership practices of principals and collective efficacy of schools affect the self-efficacy beliefs of teachers. The findings are in line with the socio-cognitive theory which assumes the presence of reciprocal relationships among leadership, organization, and person domains in shaping organizational behaviors of teachers. The study also parallels with the emerging literature about the mediating effects of collective efficacy on the relationship between principal transformational leadership and teacher self-efficacy. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited. © 2011 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - This statewide study examined the relationships between principal managerial, instructional, and transformational leadership and student achievement in public high schools. Differences in student achievement were found when schools were grouped according to principal leadership factors. Principal leadership behaviors promoting instructional and curriculum improvement were linked to achievement. Within transformational leadership, the principal's ability to identify a vision and provide an appropriate model had the greatest relationship to achievement. Principal educational level also positively correlated with each leadership factor. © 2011 SAGE Publications. © 2011 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Purpose: Most studies on the impact of school culture focus only on teachers' average perceptions and neglect the possibility that a meaningful increment to the prediction of school effectiveness might be provided by the variance in teachers' culture perceptions. The objectives of this article are to (a) better understand how teachers' collective decision making and principal's leadership are related to the schools' culture homogeneity and (b) test the moderating role of the schools' culture homogeneity on the relationship between four cultural scales and the schools' mathematics achievement. Method: The sample of this study consisted of 2,595 students nested in 52 schools and 125 classes from the French-speaking community of Belgium. Students performed two mathematics achievement tests and answered a self-reported questionnaire on their backgrounds. All the teachers (n = 817) of the 52 schools answered a self-reported questionnaire dealing with the principal's leadership, school culture, and teacher collegiality. Hypotheses are tested using correlation, regression, and hierarchical regression analyses. Research Findings: First, it was found that culture homogeneity is positively associated with (a) the principal's transformational leadership (TL) and (b) the teachers' collective decision making relative to pedagogical aspects. Second, it was shown that the impact of TL on culture homogeneity is partially mediated by teachers' collective decision making. Third, the analyses found no moderation effect of culture homogeneity on the relationship between cultural values and students' achievement but did show partial evidence of such an effect in specific groups of schools (with low or high socioeconomic status composition). Implications: This study provides a deeper understanding of how social arrangements and leadership processes within schools contribute to the emergence of collective cultural values. But the results also shed light on the weak associations between cultural values and student achievement, even when considering an appropriate definition and conceptualization of the school culture. © 2009 The University Council for Educational Administration. © 2009 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this study was to examine the relative impact of different types of leadership on students' academic and nonacademic outcomes. Research Design: The methodology involved an analysis of findings from 27 published studies of the relationship between leadership and student outcomes. The first meta-analysis, including 22 of the 27 studies, involved a comparison of the effects of transformational and instructional leadership on student outcomes. The second meta-analysis involved a comparison of the effects of five inductively derived sets of leadership practices on student outcomes. Twelve of the studies contributed to this second analysis. Findings: The first meta-analysis indicated that the average effect of instructional leadership on student outcomes was three to four times that of transformational leadership. Inspection of the survey items used to measure school leadership revealed five sets of leadership practices or dimensions: establishing goals and expectations; resourcing strategically; planning, coordinating, and evaluating teaching and the curriculum; promoting and participating in teacher learning and development, and ensuring an orderly and supportive environment. The second meta-analysis revealed strong average effects for the leadership dimension involving promoting and participating in teacher learning and development and moderate effects for the dimensions concerned with goal setting and planning, coordinating, and evaluating teaching and the curriculum. Conclusions and Implications for Research and Practice: The comparisons between transformational and instructional leadership and between the five leadership dimensions suggested that the more leaders focus their relationships, their work, and their learning on the core business of teaching and learning, the greater their influence on student outcomes. The article concludes with a discussion of the need for leadership research and practice to be more closely linked to the evidence on effective teaching and effective teacher learning. Such alignment could increase the impact of school leadership on student outcomes even further. © 2008 The University Council for Educational Administration. © 2008 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Principals are held accountable for student achievement although most studies find that they have no direct effect on it. In this study we tested a model hypothesizing that principals contribute to student achievement indirectly through teacher commitment and beliefs about their collective capacity. Path analysis of data from 205 elementary schools supported this hypothesis. Schools with higher levels of transformational leadership had higher collective teacher efficacy, greater teacher commitment to school mission, school community, and school-community partnerships, and higher student achievement. Increasing the transformational leadership practices in schools makes a small but practically important contribution to overall student achievement. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - In the present study, the direct effect of principal transformational leadership to school staff turnover and school performance was examined, in addition to its indirect effect through school staff job satisfaction. Survey data were obtained from elementary school staff and students, and school-aggregated student achievement test scores were obtained from school archives. Results showed that staff reports of principal behaviors could be described in terms of the three components of transformational leadership: inspiration or charisma, individualized consideration, and intellectual stimulation. Principal transformational leadership was not associated directly with either school staff turnover or school-aggregated student achievement progress. Rather, principal transformational leadership showed an indirect effect, through staff job satisfaction, on school staff turnover (negative) and on school-aggregated student achievement progress (positive). Finally, higher levels of school staff job satisfaction were associated with smaller achievement gaps between minority and non-minority students. This result was more evident among schools having higher levels of principal transformational leadership. Results are discussed in relation to the role of transformational leadership in school performance and in recruiting, training, and evaluating school principals. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited. © 2014 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Focusing on school leadership relations between principals and teachers, this study examines the potential of their active collaboration around instructional matters to enhance the quality of teaching and student performance. The analysis is grounded in two conceptions of leadership- transformational and instructional. The sample comprises 24 nationally selected restructured schools - 8 elementary, 8 middle, and 8 high schools. In keeping with the multilevel structure of the data, the primary analytic technique is hierarchical linear modeling (HLM). The study finds that transformational leadership is a necessary but insufficient condition for instructional leadership. When transformational and shared instructional leadership coexist in an integrated form of leadership, the influence on school performance, measured by the quality of its pedagogy and the achievement of its students, is substantial. © 2012 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Transformational leadership theory was examined in 89 schools in Singapore using a split sample technique (N = 846 teachers). The study sought to examine the influence of transformational leader behavior by school principals as it related to organizational commitment, organizational citizenship behavior, teacher satisfaction with leader, and student academic performance. Attitudinal and behavioral data were collected from both teachers and principals; student academic performance was collected from school records. School level analyses showed that transformational leadership had significant add‐on effects to transactional leadership in the prediction of organizational commitment, organizational citizenship behavior, and teacher satisfaction. Moreover, transformational leadership was found to have indirect effects on student academic achievement. Finally, it was found that transactional leadership had little add‐on effect on transformational leadership in predicting outcomes. Implications and directions for future research are discussed.

AB  - Collaborative school cultures have been associated with the achievement of a number of school reform objectives for both teachers and students. Little is known, however, about how such cultures develop and whether or how school administrators can facilitate that process. This study examined the practices of administrators in each of 12 schools which had developed highly collaborative professional relationships over a three year period in the context of school improvement initiatives. Results suggest the feasibility of developing more collaborative school cultures in a relatively brief period of time and clarify the role played by the larger context of school improvement for fostering collaboration. Specific strategies used by the administrators are described. These strategies are associated with a concept of leadership termed “transformational”. © 1990, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.
